name: write-scenario
description: Scenario factory — runs one assignment through the write → compile → lint → paper-check → revise loop, producing a validated datapack and a verdict memo, and on request hardens a selected pack into a playable one. Args - brief file path (replaces built-in §1–§3) · draft-only (write, then stop) · existing draft path (skip writing, run the validation loop only) · harden <slug> (skip writing, run §7 against an existing pack). Format canon - drafts follow §4, datapacks follow data/scenario/_schema.

# Scenario factory

The session running this skill is the **orchestrator** — it does not write. §0–§5
are the material fed wholesale to the writing sub-agent (the entirety of the
writer's world); the process this session follows is §6, and §7 when asked. The
default product is a bundle that has passed the validation loop: **datapack +
verdict memo + draft diff + remainder list**. All produced artifacts (draft,
datapack, memos) are written in Korean.

**That default pack is not playable, and that is deliberate.** The loop produces
a *draft-stage* pack: no meter is bound to an engine variable, no gate carries
buckets, `symptoms.json` is `{}`, and lint's FLAG list is the hardening
worklist. Making it playable is §7, and §7 runs **only when asked**, because the
manual is written for the scenario that was chosen (`당선 시나리오 확정 후`) and
hardening a candidate you will discard is wasted work.

**Args:** brief file path (replaces §1–§3) · `draft-only` (stop after §6-1) ·
existing draft path (skip §6-1, enter §6-2 with that draft) · `harden <slug>`
(skip §6 entirely, run §7 against an existing pack).

## 0. Preparation — what to read, and what not to

1. Read `docs/scenario/scenario-generation-guide.md`. **Every rule in that
   document is a law of physics** — a constraint, not a taste; a scene that
   violates one cannot ship in the game.
2. **Read no other document in the repository** — no specs, reports, meeting
   notes, or other drafts. Everything you need is in this brief and the guide.
   Reading technical documents lets their vocabulary seep into your prose, and
   the scenario dies.
3. If a brief file path was passed as an argument, read it and follow it in
   place of §1–§3. §0, §4, and §5 always apply.

## 1. Game context

- **World:** the player is a new hire at the 국가재난대응실 — the national
  disaster response office, where a report call comes in and 요원 are
  dispatched to it with the situational knowledge the desk can give them.
  Before real duty, the player trains on the 국가재난모의포탈, a portal that
  replays **reconstructions of disasters that actually happened**. The people
  inside already died. The portal asks one question: could you have solved
  it?
- **The record is not open.** Because this is an examination, the portal
  hands over only what the duty officer held that day — the incoming report
  call, and what the 요원 sends back. **The truth is inside the
  reconstruction, but not in a form a human can open.** There is exactly one
  way to read it: send **a single AI 요원** in to live through it and receive
  its report. Again and again — watch the failure → read the report → revise
  the handover → send them back in. A game of completing, by trial and error,
  the 요원 who resolves the situation.
- **The 요원's verbs are reading, judging, persuading, and setting
  priorities.** The 요원 is an LLM — it solves problems with words and
  judgment, not physical force.
- **The disaster itself cannot be prevented. What the 요원 contends with is
  people.** The disaster is the clock; humans are the puzzle — the old man
  who refuses to evacuate, the official who covers up, the crowd in panic.
- **The reconstruction runs on a fixed timeline.** Without the 요원's
  intervention, the same things happen at the same times, every run. So the
  fact that "the stairwell collapses at 19:40" can only be learned in a run
  that reached 19:40 — a run that goes further mines deeper truth.
- **One situation is one report call to its resolution — roughly two to three
  hours.** The clock is short, so its graduations must be fine: twelve hours
  at one-hour steps and two and a half hours at fifteen-minute steps are the
  same depth. Shorten the span without multiplying the layers and the world
  runs dry by run 3.
- **Depth has two axes.** The clock — a run that lasted longer sees more. And
  **gate outcome** — which way the 요원 broke at an earlier gate changes what
  surfaces later. The second axis works **within a run only**: nothing about
  which stance was taken survives into the next run. So
  `요원이 옥상에 함께 오른 런에서 보임` is writable and
  `요원이 옥상에 함께 오른 런 이후로 보임` is not. This axis does not
  accumulate across runs — it makes runs differ from one another.
- **Name the outcome, never the gate.** Write that second axis as something
  that happened in the world — `요원이 옥상에 함께 오른 런`,
  `관장이 종이를 두 장 편 런` — never as `G3에서 동행을 택한 런`. `G1`,
  `갈림길`, `게이트` are words for the workshop, and the timeline is read by
  the player. The rule is not a style preference: naming a gate on a player
  surface is item 9 of the guide's forbidden list, and it fails a machine
  check.
- **Sentence mining:** when a run ends, the player receives two reports (an
  objective event log + a subjective report the 요원 wrote in its own
  temperament) and **drags sentences out of them into the next run's
  handover** (`인수인계 사항`). The scenario must be dense enough in facts,
  secrets, and conjecture to feed this mining.
- **The membrane:** the player never types a single character. They only
  select sentences the reconstruction itself produced.
- **The same situation is watched repeatedly (5–10 runs).** A thin world gets
  boring by run 3. Every viewing must reveal a new face, a new secret.

## 2. Assignment

> This section is swapped out per assignment. To run a different assignment,
> replace only this section. An assignment must define the **file prefix** —
> the §4 output filename uses it.

### Free topic

The kind of disaster, the shape of the city, who was on duty that day, what
is hidden and who is confronted — all of it is yours to decide. Keep §1's
game context (a real past disaster replayed as training, one 요원, people as
the puzzle) and the guide's physics, and any stage you can imagine is open.
No differentiator, guiding question, or trap is given in advance — designing
those from a blank page is part of this assignment's writing, and the logline
should be their answer.

**The single restriction:** the bomb threat phoned in by a voice nobody can
place is already taken by another assignment. Every situation opens on a
report call, so the phone line itself is not off limits — that particular
caller is.

**File prefix:** `자유주제`

## 3. Quantities

Span roughly 2–3 hours · gates 3 · 인물 exactly 3 · places 3–5 ·
hidden truths 3–4 · timeline rows 20–25 · score units 4 or fewer.

**A judge plays this for minutes, not hours.** Every number above is sized for
someone who will see three or four runs and then decide. Anything the player
must read twice to hold is a number too large.

**The span must close before midnight.** Not a taste — the sim clock is
same-day only, and it ends the run the moment its minute counter reaches the
terminal stamp. A band that reads 21:47 → 00:12 is *already ended* when the
run is built: the clock never ticks, the progress bar's span collapses to one
minute, and the game boots into a finished day. `compile-datapack.mjs` refuses
a timeline whose rows would cross midnight, so this fails loudly at compile
rather than quietly on the desk. An evening scenario starts early enough that
its last row still lands on the same date.

**Three people, three gates — one gate belongs to each.** There is no 조연
tier: a body that brushes the story once and leaves is furniture, and
furniture belongs in the timeline's prose, not in the cast. Three is few
enough that a face arrives fully formed on its first appearance, and that each
gate can be *about* somebody rather than about a decision with people nearby.

**Twenty-odd rows, not forty.** The clock is short and its graduations should
be fine, but fine is not the same as dense: the player reads this timeline
plus two reports every run, and ore they skim is ore they do not mine. Cut the
rows that only establish; keep the rows that carry a sentence someone will
want to hand over. If the world feels thin at 25 rows, the fix is deeper
places and more carriers per truth, not more rows.

Instead of widening, one character spans several truths and gates, and one
place yields different information at different depths. Don't stretch story
strands horizontally; stack them vertically along run depth — best of all is
a chain where a sentence carrying one truth delivers the player to the door
of the next.

**Three gates, and three is not a budget to spend up to — it is the count.**
A forking situation reads as a weighty one, which is exactly the trap: past
three, the forks stop being decisions and become a checklist the 요원 walks.
Three also keeps the locks honest. The 기질 carries at most two conditional
clauses (§4-6), so every gate past the second is another lock cut from the
same two keys; at six or seven gates a player who learns one axis opens half
the scenario at once, and the back half goes shallow in a single run. At
three, each gate can hold its own axis-and-지목 pair and stay a real question.

Spend what the gate count frees on **depth**, not on more scenes: more
carrying sentences per truth, more that one place yields at different depths.

**The three gates are not equal, and must not be.** One of them is worth tens
of lives — it is the gate the whole scenario is built to deliver the player
to. The other two are worth a named person's fate and, more importantly,
**control what can be mined before the decisive one**: an outcome at G1 is
what puts the key to G3 into the ore, or keeps it out. Three gates that each
save a third of the toll produce no moment worth replaying; one that saves
tens, reachable only through the other two, is the whole game.

**Run 1 should be short.** It is the run with an empty handover, so it is the
run that watches the day happen — and the player has to reach the score screen
fast enough to want a second one. Let the early runs end early: the 요원 is
shut out, the line is taken away, the desk stops answering. Later runs earn
their length by going further. Screen time is a reward, not a default.

## 4. Output format

Write a single file:
`data/scenario/<two-word slug>/draft.md`. The slug is two Korean words carrying
the draft's character (e.g. `깊은우물`); create that pack directory if it does
not already exist.
**This format is read by a machine** — the order and names of sections, the
table columns, the labels and shapes of items are a contract. A draft that
deviates stops the compiler with an error. Prose freedom lives inside the
sentences; the skeleton follows the below exactly. Section headers are
`## N. <name>` with exactly these nine Korean names, in this order:
`로그라인 · 고정 타임라인 · 인물 · 장소 · 숨겨진 진실 · 기질 제안 · 갈림길 · 점수 · 자기 검사`.

### 어디까지 플레이어에게 닿는가

Not all nine sections ship. Some are compiled into files the browser
downloads, and some exist only for the workshop — and you cannot tell which
from the draft, so here it is.

Read the left column as **reaches the browser**, not as *appears on screen*.
Some of it is rendered into the 요원's own prompt rather than shown to the
player; either way it has left the workshop and is fetchable, so it is written
in the world's language.

| 브라우저가 받는다 | 워크숍에 남는다 |
|---|---|
| `로그라인` · `고정 타임라인` 사건 텍스트 **와** 런 깊이 칸 · `인물`의 이름·역할·이해관계·아는 것·**눈금 라벨** · `기질 제안`의 기본 성향·조건절 본문·패배 조건·**축 이름과 축 어휘** · `갈림길`의 제목·장면·`question`·`stances`·`false_leads` · `점수`의 단위 이름과 집계 규칙 | `장소` · `숨겨진 진실` · `자기 검사` · `걸치는 줄기` · `눈금 후보`라는 말 자체 · `standard_form` · `key_examples` · `key_conditions` (축·지목·종·`targets_clause` 전부) · `점수` 표와 세 글머리 |

Two things that surprise people. **Your section headings are not the data** —
`**조건절 1 (축 어휘: …)**` is parsed into `cl1` and the words `조건절`,
`눈금 후보` never travel; what travels is the prose under them, plus the axis
name you chose. And **the split runs per-bullet, not per-section**: inside
`인물`, `걸치는 줄기` stays home while `눈금 후보`'s label ships.

The left column is the membrane, and two kinds of word are barred from it.

**Gate structure** — `G1`, `갈림길`, `게이트`, stance labels quoted as labels.

**The vocabulary of the game itself** — `런`, `에이전트`, `기질`, `stance`,
`주입`, `블록`, `조건절`, `눈금`, `플레이어`. This is the one that slips:
`재앙의 정체는 이 순간까지 간 런에서만 확정된다` names no gate and still
breaks the frame, because **the reconstruction does not know it is being
replayed.** Nobody inside that afternoon has a word for a run. Write the
sentence from inside the day — `폭발음은 기록되지 않았다` — and let the
exposure column carry when it becomes visible.

Both are checked by `datapack:lint`. Write the left column as the world
describing itself: the player is looking at a reconstruction, not at your
notes about one.

1. **`로그라인`** — 3 sentences or fewer.
2. **`고정 타임라인`** — the no-intervention event table, from the report
   call to the final clock (the span is §3's — roughly 2–3 hours). Exactly
   five columns:
   `| 시각 | 표면 | 장소 | 사건 | 처음 보이는 런 깊이 |`.
   표면 is one of `통화/CCTV/현장/문서`; 장소 is a name from the 장소 section,
   verbatim (— if none applies). The run-depth cell uses exactly one of three
   phrasings: `초반 런에도 보임` / `시계 N까지 간 런에만 보임` /
   `시계 끝까지 간 런에만 보임` — extra conditions are appended after
   `" · "`. A **gate-outcome depth** goes in that tail, in prose, named by
   what happened in the world — never by gate id or stance label:
   `초반 런에도 보임 · 요원이 옥상에 함께 오른 런에서만`. `G3에서 동행을 택한
   런에서만` says the same thing and is forbidden — this cell ships to the
   player (§4의 「어디까지 플레이어에게 닿는가」), and a gate id there is
   forbidden-list item 9. Write it as a condition on *this* run, never as
   something unlocked for runs afterward — the axis does not survive a run
   boundary (§1).

   **The tail is the one slot whose prose cannot survive to ship, and that is
   deliberate.** Every Korean phrasing of a gate outcome contains the word
   `런`, which is itself barred from player surfaces — so there is no wording
   that is both natural and clean. The draft writes prose because prose is
   what a human hardener reads; **hardening then replaces the tail with a flag
   identifier** (`roof_seen`), which has no prose in it to leak. A pack that
   still carries Korean here is unfinished, and lint says so on every such row.
   Watch the asymmetry: `시계 N까지 간 런에만 보임` is parsed into a clock
   stamp and never ships, so the same word is harmless in the first half of
   the cell and a leak in the second.
   **One exposure per row** — information with different exposure
   depths is split into separate rows.
3. **`인물`** (exactly 3) — each character in this shape:
   - Under a `**이름** (나이 · 역할)` heading, four bullets:
     `- 이해관계: …` / `- 아는 것: 항목 · 항목 · …. 모르는 것: ….`
     (items separated by `·` — commas belong inside sentences) /
     `- 눈금 후보: A · B.` (max 2 per character) /
     `- 걸치는 줄기: 진실 1·2…, 갈림길 G1·G3….` (truth and gate numbers in
     exactly this notation).
   - Every character spans two or more hidden truths or gates, and **one of
     the three owns each gate** — the person that gate is about. A character
     carrying one strand doesn't earn a slot, and at three slots there is
     nowhere for them to hide.
   - **Anyone who is not one of the three lives in the timeline's prose.** The
     crowd, the dispatcher who reads a number out, the child someone carries —
     they can be named, spoken and killed in a row of the fixed timeline
     without ever taking a slot here. This section is for the people the 요원
     argues with; everyone else is the day happening.
   - **One of the three is the face of the toll.** When the tally counts a
     crowd (§4-8), the number cannot be felt on its own — so one of these
     three stands where the number falls: known by name, reachable by the
     player, and lost in the run that changes nothing.
4. **`장소`** (3–5) — each place as a
   `**이름** — one line: what information surfaces only there.` heading,
   followed by two or more `- 깊이: 정보` bullets. 깊이 is `시계 HH:MM`
   (with an optional tail) or free prose — the depths must be genuinely
   different depths. Inside a 2–3 hour span the clock depths sit closer
   together than they used to, so one of a place's depths may instead be a
   gate-outcome depth (`G2에서 침묵을 택한 런` …) — that counts as a
   different depth even at the same clock. This section is **not** published,
   so naming the gate here is fine; the same depth written into the timeline's
   run-depth cell is not (§4-2).
5. **`숨겨진 진실`** (3–4) — each under a `**진실 N — 진실 한 문장**`
   heading:
   - Under `- 실어 나르는 문장:`, 3 or more entries of
     `- "문장 원문" — 나오는 자리(표면 · 시계 깊이 · 몇 번째 런쯤)`.
   - `- 거짓 단서: "문장" — 자리. 왜 미끼인가` — 1 or more, in the "right
     emotion, wrong person" shape.
6. **`기질 제안`** — one `**기본 성향** — …` paragraph, then up to 2
   conditional clauses, each under a
   `**조건절 N (축 어휘: 축 — '어휘', '어휘')**` heading with body text and a
   `- 패배 조건: 단, ….` bullet.
7. **`갈림길`** (exactly 3) — each gate opens with a
   `### GN 「제목」 — 시각, 장소` heading, then prose (the scene and its
   tension), then the gate card as a **yaml code block**. A gate without a
   card is unfinished:

   ```yaml
   gate: G3                          # G1..G3
   standard_form: >
     갈림길 G3에서, 기질은 기본 stance 경청을 낸다;
     열쇠 조건 k1을 만족하는 문장 주입 시 공감으로 이동한다.
   question: "이 갈림길에서 요원에게 던져지는 판단 질문"
   stances:                          # 2–4, all orientation-typed
     - { id: a, label: 추궁, desc: "발화에서 어떻게 나타나는지" }
     - { id: c, label: 경청, desc: "..." }
     - { id: d, label: 공감, desc: "..." }
   default_stance: c                 # no injection — and it must land on the record
   key_conditions:                   # a key is a condition, not a sentence — 1+
     - id: k1
       axis: 두려움                   # the axis of the clause it strikes
       referent: 발신자               # who/what it points at
       species: 사실                  # 사실 | 자기서술
       targets_clause: "기질 조건절 1"
   key_examples:                     # sentences satisfying the condition — 2+ per condition
     - { for: k1, text: "열쇠 문장 원문", mined_from: "채굴 위치 — 반드시 이 갈림길 이전" }
     - { for: k1, text: "같은 조건을 만족하는 다른 문장", mined_from: "다른 채굴 위치" }
   false_leads:
     - "옳은 정서, 틀린 사람 — 미끼 문장과 그 위치"
   ```

   Every condition needs several satisfying sentences in the ore — a lock
   with only one key is a lottery, not deduction. (This card format is a
   synchronized copy of the authoring-tool canon — the session follows this
   copy alone.)

   **`default_stance` is where the first run goes, so it is where the record
   goes.** With an empty handover the 요원 takes the default at every gate, so
   the all-default path across your three gates must reproduce the fixed
   timeline exactly — the day as it actually happened, with nothing improved.
   Write each `default_stance` as the stance that changes nothing: the one
   that defers, or accepts what the authority says, or walks past. If a
   stance would save someone, spare a building, or open a document, it is not
   the default of that gate — it is what a handover has to buy.

   **Three gates, two clauses — so the 지목 is what keeps the locks apart.**
   A key is 축 × 지목 × 인증 종, and a sentence with the right axis pointed at
   the wrong thing opens nothing (that is measured, not assumed). Two axes are
   therefore not two locks: **no two key conditions in the whole scenario may
   share the same `(axis, referent, species)` triple**, and a machine check
   enforces it. Vary the 지목 first — the same 하중 axis can point at the roof
   plant, at the truss, at the gutter, and each is a different lock.

   Two more, for the same reason. **Both 조건절 must be used, and neither may
   own all three gates** — if one clause opens everything, a player who learns
   one axis on run 3 has the rest for free. And **at least one condition
   should be `자기서술` pointed at the 요원 itself**, drawn from what it wrote
   about its own mistake in an earlier report: a self-description key cannot
   be learned once as a world-fact, it has to be re-earned each run, so it
   resists the flattening the other keys are prone to.
8. **`점수`** — a table
   `| 단위 | 무엇이 집계되나 | 무개입 기준 | 소급되는 갈림길 |`
   (the baseline in concrete numbers; gates in GN notation), followed by
   three bullets: `**무개입 기준 점수(자연 기준):**` ·
   `**못 막은 런들끼리도 점수가 다르다:**` ·
   `**막은 런에도 치른 값이 남는다:**`.
   **Do not make "did the disaster happen" the only tally.** Instead of the
   prevented/not-prevented binary, let the occurrence itself vary by degree
   (scale, place, time) and tally in units of people — those evacuated in
   time, the one wrongfully arrested, how the caller ends. Runs that failed
   to prevent it must still score differently from each other, and a run
   that prevented it must still carry a price. **The no-intervention baseline
   is not invented — it is the record.** A run where the 요원 changed nothing
   replays what actually happened that day, and that result *is* the baseline
   score. The player competes against the record, every run.

   **The day kills more than a hundred people, and a good run saves most of
   them.** This sets the shape of everything above it. A toll in the single
   digits cannot be felt across a score screen, and it makes one mining
   decision worth one life — which is a puzzle, not a disaster. Build the
   situation so the record runs to **three digits**: a crowd has to be
   somewhere it cannot leave quickly, and the clock has to reach it. A
   stadium, a ferry, a platform at rush hour, a tower with one stair.

   **One unit carries the number; the rest carry the names.** Four units at
   most, and exactly one of them is the crowd count — that is the unit whose
   value the tally screen shows against the record, and `137 → 62` is legible
   in a second where six mixed units are not. The other units are the three
   people: what each of them loses, and whether they are alive at 상황 종료.

   **Zero is reachable, and the disaster still happens.** The floor of the
   crowd count is **0** — every single person out in time is a run the player
   can achieve, and it must feel like winning rather than like a smaller
   number. This does not soften §1: the roof still comes down, the ferry still
   lists, the platform still floods. What the 요원 changes is who is standing
   there when it does. So `막은 런에도 치른 값이 남는다` is paid by the other
   units, never by keeping a body on the crowd count — the whistleblower is
   prosecuted anyway, the building is condemned, the one who stayed behind to
   hold a door is still lost.

   **The first run is the worst run. This is an invariant, not a tendency.**
   The 무개입 기준 column is not a description sitting beside the game — it is
   what the machine computes when no handover is carried, and the two must be
   the same number. So write every unit's baseline as the *worst* value that
   unit can take: the most dead, the most trapped, the wrongly arrested one
   still arrested, the collapse at its widest. Nothing the player does may
   land below it. If some intervention would make a unit worse than the
   record — a run that gets someone killed who survived that day — then the
   record was not the floor and the baseline is miswritten; move the worse
   outcome into the baseline and let the intervention climb from there.

   Every later run is measured as distance from that floor, which is what
   makes run 1 legible: the player watches the day happen, and every run
   after is an argument with it.
9. **`자기 검사`** — for each of the 9 items on the guide's forbidden list,
   one line confirming this draft does not violate it, plus a 10th line
   confirming the translationese sweep (§5, "The language of the draft") was
   run. If you discover a violation, fix it first, then submit.

## 5. Attitude

- Write as boldly as the rules allow. Rules are the floor of the stage, not
  the ceiling of imagination.
- Density over volume. Every character a secret, every place a reason — the
  cast is small precisely so one person can carry several strands.
- Technical vocabulary (stance, delta, prompt, …) appears nowhere outside
  the gate section's yaml cards — the scenario body is written in the
  world's own language.

### The language of the draft

Write Korean from the first word. Do not outline, plan beats, or draft in
English and then render into Korean — every intermediate artifact (beat
plans, notes to self, discarded variants) is also written in Korean.
Translated Korean has a smell, and mined sentences carry that smell straight
into the game.

Before submitting, sweep the draft for the usual translationese tells
(this sweep is the 10th line of `자기 검사`):

- **Pronouns 그/그녀/그것/그들** — Korean repeats the name or drops the
  subject. `그녀는 대장을 덮었다` → `윤은 대장을 덮었다`.
- **`~에 의해` passives and `~되어지다`** — prefer the active voice or a
  plain intransitive. `일지가 실장에 의해 폐기되었다` →
  `실장이 일지를 폐기했다`.
- **`~에도 불구하고`** → `그런데도` / `~는데도`.
- **Possessive chains `A의 B의 C`** — recast. `그의 아버지의 공장의 장부` →
  `아버지 공장 장부`.
- **Plural `-들` where number is already clear.** `세 명의 직원들이` →
  `직원 셋이`.
- **`가장 ~한 것 중 하나`** — commit to one: `손꼽히는` / `몇 안 되는`.
- **Stacked 관형절** mimicking English relative clauses — break the
  sentence instead of nesting it.
- **English punctuation habits** — semicolons, mid-sentence parenthetical
  asides.

Register anchors — match these *shapes*, never their content. Timeline rows
are clipped report prose:

- ✗ `그 노인은 그의 오래된 관리동에서 무언가를 태우고 있는 것이 목격되었다`
- ✓ `관리인이 관리동 뒤에서 서류를 태운다. 연기가 CCTV에 걸린다`

Scene prose breathes, but in Korean cadence — short clauses, dropped
subjects, weight at the end of the sentence:

- ✗ `그녀는 전화를 받았고, 그것은 그녀가 오랫동안 기다려왔던 전화였다`
- ✓ `기다리던 전화였다. 수화기를 드는 손이 느렸다`

## 6. Process — orchestrator only

> The writing sub-agent does not follow this section. §0-2's reading
> isolation is the writer's rule; the orchestrator reads repository
> documents freely.

1. **Write** — spawn one sub-agent. Its task: read §0–§5 of this file plus
   the guide (`docs/scenario/scenario-generation-guide.md`) and **follow
   §0–§5 only; §6 and §7 are process documents — ignore them**. If a brief argument
   exists, pass it per §0-3. So the orchestrator's vocabulary cannot seep
   into the draft, **writing always happens in a sub-agent**. If
   `draft-only`, report the draft path and stop.
   **Compose the spawn prompt itself in Korean.** This document is English,
   but output language tracks context language — the writer's world must
   stay Korean-dominant, and the prompt is the first thing in it. Open with
   a Korean authorial persona (e.g. `당신은 한국어로 단련된 장르
   작가다. 번역하지 않는다 — 처음부터 한국어로 사고하고 쓴다.`), then give
   the task framing and the §0–§5/§6 boundary in Korean. The persona line
   sets the register more than any instruction about register does.
2. **Machine gate** —
   `node authoring/compile-datapack.mjs <draft>` →
   `node authoring/lint-datapack.mjs data/scenario/<slug>`.
   Compile errors and lint ERRORs that are **format-only** are fixed directly
   by the orchestrator (table columns, label shapes, id notation — **never
   change a single character of sentence text**). Errors format can't fix
   belong to §6-4.
3. **Paper check** — one checker sub-agent: reads the manual
   (`docs/scenario/gate-hardening-manual.md`) + guide + draft + pack and
   checks only this — the manual §6's three lenses (timeline preemption ·
   fixture margin · escape-hatch/dead-row stances) + the card level (do the
   key examples' species and mining sites cohere with the condition and the
   gate's clock). Every finding must **cite the manual/guide clause it rests
   on** and be classed as one of three: **draft-fixable** (resolved by
   editing the draft) / **cross-track** (tied to engine/contract — the draft
   can't fix it) / **advisory** (recommendation). A finding that cannot cite
   a clause is dropped — that is what makes the loop converge.
   Two things that must go into the checker's prompt (learned in the first
   live run):
   - **State the surface the judgment call actually sees**: the judgment
     payload is the timeline excerpt · gate question · stance set ·
     injection block, nothing else (call contract §2). The card's scene
     prose is not payload — preemption verdicts attach only to
     fixed-timeline/fixture text; a conclusion leaking in scene prose is
     classified as an advisory ("careful fixture authoring at hardening").
   - **Dead rows cannot be confirmed on paper** — choice distribution is
     probe territory (manual §6). Dead-row candidates are advisory.
   The check memo is a **proposal** — the orchestrator adjudicates the
   classifications (rejects over-promotions and misapplied clauses, and
   records each rejection's reason in the memo).
   Output: `data/scenario/<slug>/paper-check.md`
   (verdict: 통과 / 조건부 통과 / 재작업 + per-lens table + prescriptions +
   adjudication record).
4. **Revise** — if draft-fixable blockers exist, one reviser sub-agent:
   reads the guide + draft + memo **only**, and fixes **only the lines the
   memo names**. A sentence not named is not touched by a single character —
   the draft's sentences are the ore. If a fix moves a key example or its
   mining site, the card's matching fields move with it.
5. **Loop** — run §6-2 → §6-3 again. Exit condition: lint ERROR 0 **and**
   draft-fixable blockers 0. Maximum 3 rounds — if anything remains, stop
   and report it as remainder.

   **"Blockers 0" is a verdict, not an inference.** Only §6-3 can establish
   it, so a round that fixes every named blocker and then stops at the machine
   gate has **paused, not exited** — lint cannot see a preemption or an escape
   hatch, which is why §6-3 exists. Either run the confirming check or say in
   the report that the last verdict on record is the one *before* the fixes,
   and name which blockers were fixed without re-reading.
6. **Report** — close with the bundle: pack path · final verdict memo ·
   draft diff (against the freshly written draft) · remainder list
   (cross-track / advisory / "lint promotion candidates" — a finding a
   machine could have caught proposes a rule promotion) · a summary of
   remaining lint WARN·FLAG. **Passing this loop does not replace the human
   read of manual §6** — the report must state that one human read before
   the probe still stands. State plainly that the pack is **draft-stage and
   not playable**, and that §7 is what makes it so — the FLAG count is that
   sentence in numbers.

## 7. Hardening — orchestrator only, and only when asked

> Runs on `harden <slug>`, never as part of a default run. Read
> `docs/scenario/gate-hardening-manual.md` in full first — §6 used it as the
> checker's rulebook; here it is the instruction set.

**Precondition, and what to do when it is not met.** The input is a pack with
lint ERROR 0 and a §6-3 verdict of 통과 or 조건부 통과. A 재작업 verdict whose
blockers were all fixed **does not become 통과 by being fixed** (§6-5) — the
verdict on record is still 재작업, because nothing re-read the draft. Two ways
forward, and pick deliberately rather than by default:

- **Run §6-3 once more first.** Correct, and the only option if any fix
  touched a stance set, a key example or a timeline row near a gate — those
  are exactly what a paper check sees and lint does not.
- **Proceed on the stale verdict.** Acceptable when every blocker was
  individually verified and the fixes were narrow. Then say so in the §7-5
  report, in these words: which verdict is on record, that it predates the
  fixes, and what went unread. Hardening on an unconfirmed draft is a choice
  someone may need to revisit; it must not be discoverable only by reading
  timestamps.

**Why this is a separate stage and not the loop's last step.** The manual is
addressed to the session that runs *after* a scenario is chosen. Hardening is
also the only place three of lint's rules can fail: `E-P5`, symptom coverage
and `E8` all need buckets to exist before they mean anything, so a draft-stage
pack passes them vacuously. Hardening is where they start biting.

1. **Order is forced, because each artifact names the one before it.** Buckets
   declare the flags; the score ladders and the symptom dictionary can only
   read flags that already exist. Author in this order, in one pass per gate:

   1. **`buckets`** in the draft's yaml cards (manual §5 is the canon; the
      draft is where they live, so recompiling stays idempotent). 2–4 per
      gate, every stance covered, deltas non-zero integers.
   2. **`hardening.json`** — `characters` (meter → engine variable + integer
      initial), `timeline` (per event `time` · `text_head` · `effects` ·
      `present[]`), `symptoms`.

      **`effects` defaults to explicit `{}` on every event.** The fixed
      timeline is the day that happened; what the player changes rides on gate
      buckets, and `{}` says "authored, none" where `null` says "not looked
      at yet" — which is why the empty object clears the worklist flag and the
      null does not. Give an event a real effect only when the record itself
      must assert something no bucket can, and know the price before you do:
      **every settable flag needs its own symptom sentence**, so one timeline
      flag is one more piece of authored prose, and a flag that only the fixed
      timeline sets is unreadable by any predicate anyway (`E-P3`) — it can
      only ever be texture.
   3. **`집계 규칙:`** fence under §8, keyed by the exact unit label from the
      table, ordered, fallback last.
   4. **Exposure tails** — replace the Korean in each run-depth cell's
      `" · "` tail with the flag identifier that now exists. This is what
      finally clears `W-V2`; see §4-2.

2. **The rules that only exist here.** Each one is an ERROR, not taste:
   - **No default-stance bucket sets a flag any score ladder reads** (`E-P5`).
     The all-default path is the first run, and the first run is the record —
     §4-8. Meter deltas on a default bucket are fine; flags are not.
   - **Score conditions read intervention flags only**, never scalars, or the
     default bucket's deltas reach the ladder by the back door.
   - **Symptom coverage** — every `(variable, direction)` a bucket can reach
     needs a list with a `min: 1` floor, entries in descending `min` order,
     and a sentence for every settable flag. No digits in symptom text.
   - **`text_head` is derived, not typed.** Slice it from the compiled
     `timeline.json`; a hand-typed head that drifts from the event stops the
     compiler, and forty of them typed by hand is forty chances to be wrong.

3. **Split the work by what it is.** The rosters and text heads are mechanical
   — derive them from the compiled pack with a script rather than by hand. The
   design-bearing parts (which meters bind and to what initials, delta sizes,
   flag semantics, and every symptom sentence) are authored, and the symptom
   sentences are **prose**: spawn a sub-agent with §5's Korean persona for
   them, exactly as §6-1 does, or they arrive in translationese.

4. **Machine gate** — recompile, then lint. Recompiling merges the overlay, so
   it is also the check that the overlay actually bound: the compile NOTE
   reports how many characters, events and symptom variables merged, and a
   zero there means the file did not take. Exit condition: **lint ERROR 0**,
   and the FLAG list reduced to items that are genuinely someone else's
   (routing vocabulary, engine-side gaps). Loop at most 3 times.

5. **Report** — pack path · what bound (meters, flags, symptom variables) ·
   FLAG count before and after · anything left on the worklist and whose it
   is. Then state what hardening does **not** buy: the manual's §6 human read
   still stands, and the probe (~30 calls, first gate only) is what actually
   confirms the recipe survived into this pack's fixture text. Passing lint is
   not a gate's certificate.
