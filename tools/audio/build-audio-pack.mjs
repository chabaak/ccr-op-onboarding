// reasons: spec-client §3 inv 10 forbids third-party requests at runtime, so
// every sample has to live in the repo, and CLAUDE.md rule 5 wants provenance

// origin, licence and author of every recording used, and `CUES` records the
// exact cut that turned it into a game sound. Re-running reproduces the pack.
//
// Two halves, per plan-audio §5's hybrid decision:
//   • sourced — CC0 recordings from Kenney / OpenGameArt / Wikimedia Commons,
//     cut and filtered here by ffmpeg
//   • generated — `synth.mjs`, for the cues no library does well (room tone,
//     drone, squelch, the dissonant symptom chime, the collapse)
//
// Requires ffmpeg on PATH; `--table` also requires ffprobe. Downloads are
// cached in `tools/audio/.cache/` (gitignored); only the encoded OGGs under
// `public/` are committed.
