# Extending the harness

The mechanism deep-test is the first program to use this runner, not the last.
This is how to point it at a different test without forking it.

## Mental model

A test is a **(call type × suite)** pair.

| | what it is | where it lives | changing it costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **suite** | one probe: gate, arms, N, pre-registration | `planning/<program>/suites/*.json` | data only, no code |
| **call type** | one shape of model call: schema, validation, summary | one entry in `tools/lib/calls.mjs` + a prompt pair | ~40 lines |
| **probe kind** | which slots a probe may vary across arms | one entry in `CHANNEL_SLOTS` | 1 line |
| **transport** | how the call reaches a model | one function in `lib/transport.mjs` | ~40 lines |

Everything else — the pre-registration gate, the arm-diff check, the call loop,
the recorder, the CLI — is shared and should not need touching. If a new test
makes you want to edit `run.mjs`, that is worth a second look: it usually means
the thing belongs in a call type instead.

## Recipe A — a new probe, same call type

The common case. Copy a suite, change the data, run it. No code.

```bash
cp tools/probe/dday-mechanism/suites/E0-shape-revalidation.json \
   tools/probe/dday-mechanism/suites/E1-cblock-placebo.json
# edit: experiment, pre_registration, arms (add placebo)
node tools/probe/run.mjs tools/probe/dday-mechanism/suites/E1-cblock-placebo.json --print-prompt=placebo
```

The one thing to get right is `channel`: it decides which slots the arms are
allowed to differ in. Anything else varying across arms aborts the run.

## Recipe B — a new call type

Worked examples now live in the codebase: **`narration`** and **`reporter`**
(`tools/lib/calls.mjs`, the narration and reporter prompt pairs, both v0.1)
were added this way. The steps:

1. Add `prompts/<call>/base-vX.Y.md` (proxy) and `data/prompts/<call>/user-vX.Y.md` with `{SLOT}` markers.
2. Add the entry to `tools/lib/calls.mjs`: `promptDir`, `slots`, `buildTool`
   (tool schema, or `null` for prose output), `validate`, `summarize`,
   optionally `dryRunPayload`.
3. Nothing else changes. The composer fills whatever `slots` declares — it has
   no per-call-type knowledge. `--dry-run` works immediately; add
   `dryRunPayload` only if the generic filler produces something your
   validator rejects.

Three honest exceptions, all small and by design:

- A slot whose value has *structure* (a list that needs numbering, blocks that
  need ids in front) needs one renderer entry in `RENDERERS`
  (`lib/compose.mjs`). Plain string slots need nothing.
- A call type that shares another's temperament roster sets `temperamentDir`
  (the reporter reads `judgment/temperament/` — one authored temperament per
  scenario, two copies would drift).
- Per-call-type required slots are enforced in `validateSuite`
  (`lib/suite.mjs`) so a suite missing its load-bearing slot refuses to run
  instead of composing an empty section.

**Field order is load-bearing** for tool-output call types. `judgment` fixes
`inner_note → stance → because_referent → because_block_ids → rejected_stance
→ rejected_reason → utterance` because the pre-stance
note is deliberation and the post-stance fields are post-hoc readouts. Reordering
is a shape change and needs a re-validation run, not just a code review.

## Recipe C — a new probe kind

Register the slots it may vary:

```js
export const CHANNEL_SLOTS = {
  'C-BLOCK': ['BLOCKS'],
  'MY-PROBE': ['SOME_SLOT'],
};
```

An unregistered `channel` is refused rather than defaulted to "anything goes" —
a permissive default would silently disable the arm-diff check, which is the
harness's main guarantee.

## Paper gates — run these before spending a call

Two kinds of unknown get confused, and confusing them is expensive.

- **Closed** — determined by the artifact itself. *Does every speech act the beat
  demands have a legal output slot? Does the suite meet the contract's input
  requirements? Can this comparison design detect the effect size I care about?
  Do two output fields overlap in meaning?* Reading and arithmetic settle these.
  **A call spent here buys nothing** — the answer was already available.
- **Open** — about model behaviour under a prompt. *Does haiku hedge perception
  or assert it? Is the narration mineable? What is the latency?* No amount of
  reasoning settles these. **Only calls settle these.**

Exhaust the closed ones first. This program learned that the expensive way: two
narration defects — the controller speaking with no legal speaker slot, and a
fixed action that asks the controller a question — cost 20 measured calls to
rediscover, and both were answerable from the suite file alone.

| gate | instrument | cost |
|---|---|---|
| Stance labels must not echo the fixture temperament's vocabulary (A12) | `lint-stances.mjs` | free |
| Speaker closure · beat boundary · numbers in symptoms (I12) | `lint-beat.mjs` | free |
| Suite meets the call type's input contract | `validateSuite` — refuses the run | free |
| Comparison power: minimum live count and MDE power **written into the pre-registration** (A20) | arithmetic, by hand | free |
| Two output fields must not overlap in meaning | schema review, by eye | free |
| The composed prompt reads as intended | `--print-prompt` | free |

The last one is still the cheapest bug-catcher in the program.

Both lints **flag rather than block** — only the author knows when an overlap is
load-bearing. Hard contract requirements block instead, in `validateSuite`, where
refusing is still free.

## Recipe D — a new transport

When the proxy backend exists, add it beside `anthropic` and `dryrun`:

```js
async function proxy({ system, user, tool, model, timeoutMs }) { /* … */ }
export const TRANSPORTS = { anthropic, dryrun, proxy };
```

Return the same shape: `{ ok, latency_s, model_reported, stop_reason,
foreign_tool_uses, output_tool_calls, payload, raw }`. Then select it in
`run.mjs` where `transportName` is decided.

Switching transports is a **shape change** — it can alter the generation regime,
so it carries one re-validation probe, exactly as the subagent → API switch did.

## What each planned test needs

| Test | Needs | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| C-BLOCK placebo, negative control, screening (E-DISC/E-CONT judgment leg) | suites | data only |
| **D task** (agent prompt test) — base A/B, temperament lint, conditional compliance, clause collision | suites declaring `D-TEMP` / `D-INCIDENT` | data only; both channels already registered |
| Scenario paper test (workstream P, per-gate isolation) | one suite per gate | data only |
| E-CONT report leg | **wired** — `reporter` call type + the reporter prompt pair v0.1 | suites only |
| Narration call | **wired** — `narration` call type + the narration prompt pair v0.1 | suites only |
| **B2 in-situ full run** | multi-gate sequencing + state carried between calls | see below |

### The one real gap: in-situ runs

Everything above is single-call. B2 needs a *sequence* of gates where each
judgment updates state that conditions the next — which is the deterministic
state engine from the architecture spec, not a test harness concern.

Do not grow `run.mjs` into a game engine. When B2 arrives, the right shape is a
thin driver that owns the state and calls this harness once per gate, reusing
`composeArm` and the recorder. The harness stays a probe runner; the driver owns
the run.

## Invariants a new test type must not break

These are why the harness exists rather than a script per probe. If an extension
needs to violate one, that is a finding to raise, not a flag to add.

1. **No call without a complete pre-registration** — hypothesis, N, drop
   condition. Enforced in `lib/suite.mjs`.
2. **Arms differ only in the declared slot**, verified by diff and not by
   intention.
3. **Models are pinned.** Aliases are rejected; the id is recorded per call
   alongside what the API echoed back.
4. **Artifacts are append-only.** Discards and failures stay in place, flagged.
   The runner refuses to overwrite.
5. **No verdicts in the tooling.** Raw sequences out; humans decide, after blind
   coding.
6. **Dry-run output is stamped** `dry_run: true` and never lands in a `runs/`
   directory.

## Deliberately not abstracted

- **Prompt composition is string templating with `{SLOT}` markers.** No
  conditionals, no loops, no partials. A prompt you cannot read in full by eye
  is a prompt whose diffs you cannot verify — and `--print-prompt` is the
  cheapest bug-catcher in the program.
- **No retry-until-valid on soft problems.** A hallucinated block id is data
  about the mechanism; retrying would erase the observation.
- **No aggregation beyond counts.** Rates, flip percentages, and pass/fail live
  on the verdict card written by a human, because N=3 behind a percentage is how
  a program talks itself into "verified".
