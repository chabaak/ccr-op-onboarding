// Where the three prompt layers physically live.
//
// The split is an ownership statement, not filing convenience (call contracts
// §6, "Supplier per slot"):
//
//   system  — the default prompt. FLAW · INCIDENT · PRIORITY_LIST come from here.
//   user    — the per-call template, filled from datapack + engine state +
//             player blocks.
//   temperament — probe test fixtures only. The production source of truth is
//             `data/scenario/<slug>/temperament.json` (its own schema); the
//             markdown stand-ins live under `tests/fixtures/probe/temperament`
//             until #70 teaches the harness to render from pack data directly.
//
// The system and user layers both belong to the proxy (physical architecture
// §3.10, decided 08-03): the client posts slot VALUES and the proxy renders both
// layers. Neither file ships to the browser, prompt wording changes without a
// Pages redeploy, and the renderers and output schemas live on the same side as
// the templates they serve.
//
// Node-side callers resolve paths through here so that moving a layer is one
// edit. The two roots are still named separately even though they now point at
// the same directory — they are two different owners' artifacts and the split
// has already moved once.
//
// `tools/` READING these files is a filesystem read from a sibling directory,
// not a module import: the tier boundary in physical §3.2 forbids importing the
// proxy, not reading its files. `proxy/tests/prompt-parity.test.ts` is what
// keeps the probe's rendering and the proxy's rendering from drifting.
