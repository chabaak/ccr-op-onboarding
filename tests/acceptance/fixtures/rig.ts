// [e10] the two rigs the acceptance suite drives, both over the real tutorial
// pack and the real merged `src/**` slice.
//
// Nothing here re-implements a rule. The schedule builder, the state core, the
// beat driver, the id allocator, the feed builders, the round assembler, the
// composer, the block store, the live driver and the fixture provider are all
// imported and run unmodified; what this file adds is the pack read (the engine
// is pure of `fs`, so somebody upstream has to do it), the two adapters e3's
// ports ask for, and two recorders that watch seams without changing them.
//
// The run rig below uses the shipped `createEngine` (`src/engine/index.ts`)
// rather than a rig-local rebuild of it: it is the one existing `EnginePort`
// over the merged leaves, it is parameterised by pack, and §8's criteria are
// about what that factory and its collaborators produce — not about a second
// binding written for this suite.
//
// The pack is the manifest tutorial datapack, deliberately: §8-2 asks for a
// beat whose effect moves `trust`, §8-8 for a run that generates lines on every
// channel, and §8-5 for a real Call 1 → Call 3 trace. A hand-built fixture
// could satisfy each of those and still leave the shipped scenario broken.
