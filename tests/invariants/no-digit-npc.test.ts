// [u9#c2] spec-client §3 invariant 2 (I12) — no digit ever renders for NPC state.
//
// "Symptom sentences arrive as data and are displayed verbatim; the tally's
// numbers are score, not state."
//
// SCOPE (P1-D scoping rule, [u9#c6]): **unit-scoped by selector**. The assert
// is bound to the feed's `npc` line — the one NPC channel that still reaches
// the DOM, x8 having stopped `symptom` from doing so (see `NPC_LINE_SELECTORS`)
// — and everything else is excluded *by name*, never by luck:
//
//   scoped   `.fl-npc .fl-c`                         ← NPC state, text only
//   excluded `.fl-t` (the per-line clock stamp)      ← chrome, not NPC state
//            `.clk-*` · `.tb-clock` · `.dd-*`        ← topbar clock / D-DAY
//            `.tly-*`                            ← tally = score
//
// Every selector on both lists is proven to exist on disk in (a) below, so a
// rename in u5/u7 breaks this assert loudly instead of silently widening or
// emptying its scope.
//
// The rendered-DOM half lives in `e2e/a11y.spec.ts` (`inv 2 · rendered DOM`):
// vitest runs in `environment: 'node'`, so no browser assert can live here.
//
// C3: nothing here asserts fixture CONTENT — only selectors, seam names and
// the shape of the code that paints them.

 * `append`, and `win-live-feed.css` no longer carries a skin for it. Leaving it
 * listed would have made half this scope select nothing.
 *
 * Worth recording how it would have gone unnoticed: (a) below scans the RAW
 * stylesheet text, so the removal note in `win-live-feed.css`'s own header —
 * which of course names `.fl-symptom` — answered the existence check for it.
 * The rot the assert is built to catch would have been papered over by the
 * comment explaining the rot. The kind itself is untouched: it is still on the
 * frozen seam and still reaches Call 2, which is what `NPC_FEED_KINDS` and (d)
 * go on holding.
