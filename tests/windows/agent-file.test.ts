// u4 — AGENT FILE window: the model half.
//
// SCOPE (unit-scoped, u4): this suite reads only the five sources u4 owns
// (`components/{block-card,slot-board,dossier,deploy-button}.ts` +
// `windows/agent-file.ts`) plus repo-level guards C2/C13 that name them.
//
// x10 widens that by exactly one file: `styles/win-agent-file.css`, the window's
// own sheet, read as TEXT off disk and never imported (the
// `tests/shell/sign-in.test.ts` idiom — that suite reads `signin.css` for the
// same kind of claim). It is here because x10's DEPLOY cue is a contract split
// across the two: the sheet decides which half of the cycle the animation ends
// on, and under `prefers-reduced-motion` that keyframe is the only state a
// reduced-motion operator ever sees. A node-env run cannot watch it blink, but it
// can prove the declaration that decides what the blink settles as — which is the
// half that can silently ship a DEPLOY button that looks dead.
//
// The suite runs under vitest `environment: 'node'` (u3/u9d precedent, u4 D1):
// **no DOM assert lives here** — every one of those is in `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts`.
// Each component therefore splits `pure model → DOM builder`, and only the model
// half is imported below. Modules are loaded with a dynamic `import()` off an
// absolute path (the `tests/shell/window-registry.test.ts` precedent) so a
// missing file fails one test with a readable message instead of the file.
//
// Test titles are load-bearing — the unit's verification commands filter with
//   -t 'sealed by construction'            (c2)
//   -t 'membrane ops'                      (c3)
//   -t 'slot anchors expose data-block-id' (c5)
// Do not rename a describe without updating `.claude/super/units/u4.md`.
//
// C3: nothing here asserts synthetic fixture CONTENT. The ids used
// (`b-r2-f03`, `b-r2-b03`, …) are the *authored id grammar* `b-r<run>-<channel><nn>`
// which C3 itself freezes, and the Korean strings are document copy or
// spec-named copy, not fixture text.
