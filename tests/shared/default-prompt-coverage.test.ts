// The deployed agent is the measured agent — asserted, not assumed.
//
// `FLAW` · `INCIDENT` · `PRIORITY_LIST` are the proxy's, refused from the
// client, and now keyed by datapack slug. That gives the pair of ways this can
// silently go wrong, and this file closes both:
//
//   1. the shipped pack has no entry, so it plays with the incumbent's agent —
//      the proxy falls back on purpose (availability beats a dead Call 1), and
//      the fallback is only safe if something fails at merge instead;
//   2. an entry exists but has drifted from the suite that measured it, so the
//      probe numbers describe a prompt nobody sends any more.
//
// Reading the suite JSON as the expected value is the point of (2). A literal
// copied into this file would drift in exactly the same silence.
//
// This reads across the tier boundary, which is allowed in this direction:
// physical §3.3 bars `proxy/**` from importing `src/**`, and says nothing about
// a root test reading the proxy — `tests/shared/temperament.test.ts` already
// reads `proxy/prompts/*.md` for the same reason. `default-prompt.ts` imports
// nothing, so nothing of the proxy's runtime comes with it.
