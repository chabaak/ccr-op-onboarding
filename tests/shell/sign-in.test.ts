// [x9] the door types itself in — `shell/sign-in.ts`.
//
// The split is the one `ending.test.ts` and `tutorial-observer.test.ts` both
// make: what a node-env run can PROVE, and what only a browser can. The plate,
// the caret hand-off, the grey slab going hot and the door actually opening are
// DOM and live in `e2e/signin.spec.ts`. What is proved here is the half that
// decides whether the door is CORRECT rather than whether it is handsome:
//
//  1. **The count arithmetic.** `doorFill` is the entire state machine, and its
//     off-by-ones are the ones that matter: a door that arms LOGIN at fourteen
//     opens on a half-typed card, and one that arms at sixteen never opens at
//     all. Pinned at every boundary, plus the two the design turns on — the
//     seventh press, which completes the id AND moves the caret in one move, and
//     the fifteenth, which is the only press that changes the button.
//
//  2. **That the lengths are 7 and 8 by DERIVATION.** The brief said "first 7
//     inputs" and "the next 8" because that is how long a badge number and a
//     mask are. `STROKES` is a sum, never a literal, so the guard is that the
//     two card values still add up to the door the brief describes — edit
//     `SIGN_IN.secret` to nine glyphs and this suite says so.
//
//  3. **Which presses count.** `countsAsStroke` is what keeps Tab and Enter for
//     the button and ⌘R for the browser, and what keeps the door open to a
//     Korean IME. Its rule is one line and every clause of it is load-bearing,
//     so every clause is tested.
//
//  4. **THE MEMBRANE (spec-client §3 invariant 1).** The strongest statement
//     available is structural and it is asserted as such: `doorFill` takes a
//     `number`. There is no parameter through which a pressed character could
//     travel, so what appears in the wells is `SIGN_IN`'s and cannot be the
//     player's, whatever they mashed to advance it. (b) below is the behavioural
//     restatement — the same count always paints the same two lines.
