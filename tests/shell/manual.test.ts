// [x10] the onboarding briefing — `shell/manual.ts` + `styles/win-manual.css`.
//
// The module had NO suite of its own before this one: a grep for `manual.ts`
// found exactly one mention in the whole of `tests/`, and it was
// `tutorial-observer.test.ts` reading `#manual`'s z-index out of the stylesheet.
// Everything the briefing says to a judge in the first ten seconds of the game
// was therefore unpinned, which is how x10 found it — three plates whose module
// header argued at length for a walk the copy had already outgrown.
//
// The split is the one `ending.test.ts` and `sign-in.test.ts` both make: what a
// node-env run can PROVE, and what only a browser can. The plate, the veil, the
// page-turn, the focus that rides the button across the walk and the actual
// wrapping of Korean at 468px are DOM, and belong in `e2e/`. What is proved here
// is the half that decides whether the briefing is CORRECT:
//
//  1. **The copy.** It is the deliverable — the first prose a judge reads, and a
//     typo in it is not recoverable by the time anyone notices. Pinned verbatim,
//     exactly as `ending.test.ts` pins both endings.
//  2. **THE ARITHMETIC INSIDE THE COPY.** `최대 3번까지` is not a string, it is
//     `DEFAULT_TOTAL_RUNS - 1` written out in Korean: run 1 is the baseline that
//     replays the real incident, so 4 runs is 3 re-runs. `shell/manual.ts` is a
//     copy deck and deliberately does not import the constant to derive the digit
//     (a sentence assembled at runtime is a sentence its owner cannot edit), so
//     this suite is the binding. Move the allotment and this fails, which is the
//     entire point of it existing.
//  3. **That the walk still counts itself.** The `n / 2` in the head and the two
//     button labels are derived from `MANUAL_STEPS.length`. Cutting a plate must
//     re-count the walk with no other edit; a literal would silently lie.
//  4. **That the dropped plate stays dropped.** x5c's middle plate said the first
//     simulation replays the real incident and the operator should watch it.
//     Removing it was 민서's instruction (08-10) and the reason is that the first
//     run demonstrates it by being it. Copy that drifts back is the likeliest way
//     for that decision to be undone by someone who never heard it.
//  5. **The type and the geometry, as far as text on disk can carry them.** The
//     foot being shorter than the head is arithmetic over tokens, so it is
//     checkable here and pinned here. So is the ×1.2 step, the shared face, and
//     that neither leaks past `.man-plate`.
