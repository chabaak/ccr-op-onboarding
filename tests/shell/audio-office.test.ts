// [08-09] the office beyond the desk — `ambience.deskHolds` and `ambience.sparse`.
//
// This suite exists because of the 08-08 lesson recorded in the issue and PR trail:
// two regressions shipped green through a 215-test browser suite, and the reason
// was structural — `e2e/` drives the DEV fixture loop, so anything whose whole
// behaviour lives on the live path is untested there by construction. The
// office is exactly that shape. It is armed once, at `openTheRoom`, from data
// that only the live boot reads, and it then does nothing at all until its
// first interval elapses. A browser suite would watch it do nothing and pass.
//
// So what is proved here is the seam, not the sound:
//
//  1. **The shipped map parses.** `validateAudioMap` failing is not a loud
//     failure — `index.ts` catches it, warns, and leaves the desk SILENT
//     (audio-map's documented fallback makes that a legal outcome). A typo in
//     `audio-map.json` therefore deletes the entire audio layer without
//     breaking a single test or a single pixel. This is the guard for that.
//  2. **The new fields survive the round trip** with the values audio-map documents,
//     because they are the whole feature and they are pure data.
//  3. **The validator still refuses what it should.** A sparse block naming a
//     cue that does not exist is the exact edit a future reader makes when they
//     add a sixth office sound, and it must fail loudly at the boundary rather
//     than quietly at 3 a.m. in a judge's browser.
//
// [08-10, x10] two more claims, both of them 민서's and both live on the same
// seam: the room now opens AT THE DOOR rather than at the desk, and the ambience
// bus is quieter. The first cannot be proved here by behaviour — `installAudio`
// needs a document, a MutationObserver and an AudioContext, and this suite is
// node-env by policy — so it is proved as SHAPE, in the idiom
// `tests/shell/shell-source.test.ts` already uses for boot-order claims: the
// call site is read off disk with comments stripped. That is weaker than a
// browser assertion and stronger than nothing, and it is aimed at the exact edit
// that would undo the decision (putting `openTheRoom` back behind `deskReady`).
