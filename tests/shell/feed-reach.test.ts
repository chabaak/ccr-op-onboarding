// [x12] where the paper has GOT TO — `shell/feed-reach.ts`, the publisher in
// `components/run-feed.ts`, and the two windows that wait on it.
//
// WHAT BREAKS IF THIS IS WRONG. Since x11 the fanfold TYPES its lines and paces
// them, so it reaches a round's report tens of seconds after the seam emits it.
// `windows/reports.ts` subscribed straight to the driver, so the write-up typed
// itself — and the terminal record began counting — while the paper was still
// printing the beats they describe: the day's outcome above a fanfold still
// printing what caused it. The gate closes that, and it has two failure modes,
// both silent:
//
//  * IT NEVER OPENS. Nobody publishes the cue — no LIVE FEED was ever mounted,
//    the run number on one side does not match the other, a flush path lands the
//    paper without going through `apply` — and the day's report is simply never
//    readable. No error, no log: a window that stays blank.
//  * IT OPENS EARLY, or does not close at all. A cue keyed without its sitting
//    lets yesterday's round 1 release today's; a wait dropped from the arrival
//    path puts the document back in front of its own beats. Neither is visible
//    to a suite that only reads what the document eventually says.
//
// Neither is catchable from `e2e/reports.spec.ts` without waiting out a real
// day's paper, and a suite that can only fail by TIMING OUT is a suite nobody
// trusts. So the slot's contract is proved here directly in `environment:
// 'node'` — the module is import-safe by construction, which is itself pinned
// below — and the wiring at both ends is proved structurally, exactly as
// `feed-drain.test.ts` proves the order inside `walkEnding`.
