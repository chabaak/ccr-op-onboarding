// [#116 finding G] — contract-engine-composer §5: a round's `EXPERIENCED` is
// the timeline's own ordering, "rather than being a second, divergent log".
//
// The npc-line drop rules decide what reaches the timeline, and one of them —
// `echoes_utterance` — is a function of THIS beat's Call 1 utterance, which is
// `''` on a script beat because no Call 1 ran there. The round assembler was
// classifying every beat against the round's GATE utterance, so a script-beat
// line word-for-word identical to the gate utterance was kept on the timeline
// and dropped from the round. The player could mine it; the reporter never saw
// it happen.
//
// Driven end to end through the shipped `createEngine` and `createLiveDriver`,
// because the divergence is between two call sites that only meet in a run.
