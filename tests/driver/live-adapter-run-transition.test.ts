// The live adapter's RUN TRANSITION — the one seam the suite could not see.
//
// `e2e/` drives the DEV fixture loop (`demoRunLoop`), and `preview-smoke` proves
// the live desk boots and carries feed lines. Neither reaches
// `send({op:'new_run'})` on the live adapter, and both defects this file pins
// lived exactly there: a spent allotment acked as `ok`, and a store snapshot
// that outlived the run it described.
//
// A stubbed `LiveDriver` rather than an e2e: the adapter's contract is with the
// driver interface, and the transition is a state machine that needs no browser
// and no model. That is also why this stayed cheap enough to be worth writing.
