// The live desk, driven the way the shell drives it — the four things the
// suite could not see, because nothing in it ever ran a live run to its end.
//
// `e2e/` drives the DEV fixture loop, `preview-smoke` proves the player build
// boots and carries feed lines, and `live-adapter-run-transition` pins the
// `new_run` seam against a stub. Between them they cover the first frame and
// the turn of the day. What none of them does is PLAY one — and all four
// defects below lived past the point where the coverage stopped:
//
//   (A) the run died on its final beat, silently, so `run_end` never arrived
//   (B) the agent's report painted its opening cursor and never advanced
//   (C) a reload spent a run off the allotment
//   (D) a second MINE on one sentence dealt the card twice
//
// (A) is driven against the REAL engine, composer and pack, because that is
// what it took to see it: the stamp that killed it is authored data, and a stub
// driver invents its own stamps. The transport degrades to e6's fixture
// provider (`proxyBaseUrl: null`), so this needs no key and no network.
