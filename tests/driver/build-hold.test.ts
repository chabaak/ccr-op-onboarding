// The BUILD hold — spec-client §5.1's `BUILD → (deploy) RUN`, on the seam.
//
// THE DEFECT. The shell opens the desk with `start()` + `advance(0)`
// (`shell/boot.ts` step 5) so the run's `meta` — the counter, the pips, the
// callsign the fanfold's header prints — is on the chrome the moment the page
// boots. That release also let out everything else stamped at the opening
// minute, and on the demo run that is the case's first script event and 서지형's
// first line. So the LIVE FEED printed the day's opening while the AGENT FILE
// was still empty and ECHO had not gone in — the operator watched the run
// begin before they were given anything to begin it with.
//
// On the LIVE path it cost more than a line. `kick()` steps the next beat as
// soon as nothing is pending and the clock has caught up to the frontier, which
// at boot is both — so Call 1 went to the model with `membrane.deployed()`
// empty: the first gate of every day was judged with no agent file at all, and
// the file the operator then committed only ever reached the beats after it.
//
// Both halves are held at the same place and by the same rule, once per driver
// shape: nothing STAMPED is released and no beat is stepped until a `deploy` op
// arrives. `meta` still goes out at boot — it describes the day rather than
// happening inside it — and `drain()` keeps its override, being the DEV/TEST
// hook no player build hands out.
//
// vitest runs `environment: 'node'`: everything below is driver-level. The
// desk-level half — an empty fanfold that fills on the press — rides
// `e2e/live-feed.spec.ts`.
