// [e7#A14·A15] — the two boundaries this unit is not allowed to cross.
//
// A14: `tests/driver/` already held the client seam suites (u2). e7 ADDS files
// under that directory and rewrites none of them, so the five pre-existing
// files are pinned by content hash — the same technique the isomorphism guard
// uses on `tsconfig.core.json`, and for the same reason: a byte pin is the only
// check that cannot be satisfied by a plausible-looking edit.
//
// A15: `src/driver/` is compiled by `tsconfig.core.json`, which omits the DOM
// lib and empties `types`, so a host global does not RESOLVE there. This suite
// is the second half of that guard: it proves the folder does not reach for one
// by an injected-looking name, and that it imports nothing above itself.
