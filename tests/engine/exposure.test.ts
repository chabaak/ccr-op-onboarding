// [e3 · F4] `exposure.extra_condition` is read on EVERY surface a beat reaches.
//
// The slot decides whether an authored row happened on this run. It was read in
// exactly one place — `engine/index.ts`'s `scriptLinesOf`, which builds the
// feed — while the beat driver's `fixedAction` and `presentNpcs` walked
// `beat.events` whole. So the paper printed the branch the run took and the
// PROMPT was handed every branch the pack authored, under a heading that
// introduces the slot as `[이미 일어난 일 — 이대로 일어났다 … 모순되지도 마라]`.
// On 멈춘회전문 that is two mutually exclusive endings in one request.
//
// Nothing caught it, and the reason is worth keeping: `availability` — the
// sibling F4 slot, same rule, same un-hardened-prose exemption — has had a test
// block since it landed (`beat/schedule.test.ts`), and `extra_condition` had
// none at all. Every assert in the repo read the feed.
//
// SCOPE: engine-scoped. (a) proves the RULE on hand-built packs, because a rule
// stated on a fixture is a rule and not a coincidence of today's pack; (b)
// walks the pack the deploy actually ships and holds the two surfaces against
// each other, because that is the shape the defect took and a fixture cannot
// notice a pack that grows a new conditional row tomorrow.
