## 0. Frame

A run is one whole day. The phase cycle is `RunPhase` at
`src/client/shell/run-state.ts:23` (`build | run | report | tally`), moved by the
reducer at `:98-141`; `:68-69` warns that the demo fixture's `round = run` is a
property of that fixture and not of the seam. Gates are beats inside a run;
reports are per round.

The day's bounds are authored at `data/scenario/우는다리/meta.json` (`clock.start`
`08:50`, `clock.end` `21:04+`) and read by `src/client/shell/pack.ts:26-32`, which
strips the `+`. The DEV fixture repeats them at
`src/client/driver/fixtures/woodari-run03.ts:223-224`, but the deployed build
never loads it — `src/client/driver/run-loop.ts:176-177` returns `null`
outside `import.meta.env.DEV`. **Editing the fixture changes nothing on the
played site.**

The client's `RUN nn` labels contradict the frame and are corrected in G3.

Gate structure must not reach the player. `docs/spec-client.md:113-115` carries
this as review-blocking **invariant 6** in §3, and the 08-03 decision log binds it
for the archive. §1.G items are defects against that rule, not feature requests —
and the surface includes anything fetchable from the deployed site, not only what
is drawn.

## 1. Items

### G — Gate exposure

| id | item | where | cost | landed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1a | the pack shipped whole, so `dist/data/scenario/우는다리/draft.md` (44 kB) was readable by URL | `vite.config.ts:45-73` enumerates by file; 22 published files → 8 | — | `e270604` |
| G1b | LIVE FEED printed `(갈림길 G1의 자리)` … `(갈림길 G6의 자리)`, six distinct strings | removed from `data/scenario/우는다리/timeline.json` **and** `draft.md`, or the next `datapack:compile` restores it | — | `e270604` |
| G1c | two more leaks sat inside files entitled to ship: `gates.json:44` `key_examples[].mined_from` ("런 1 객관 로그 · 시계 09:40 — 다음 런의 G1 이전에 채굴 가능", 18 such values, 12 naming a gate) and `characters.json` `strands.gate_ids` | `tests/scaffold/no-gate-vocab.test.ts` scans every string value through `publishedContentOf()` (`vite.config.ts:159-164`); `gates[].gate` exempt by path and exact shape | — | `e270604` |
| G2 | LIVE FEED names the fault in mechanism terms | `src/client/components/fallback-notice.ts:27-31` — see below | S | #156 |
| G4 | AGENT FILE 행동 원칙 reads as a manual | hardcoded at `src/client/components/dossier.ts:102`, **not** authored in the datapack | S | #159 |
| G3 | REPORTS rail labels every segment `RUN nn` | `src/client/components/report-archive.ts` — see below | M | #180 |

**G2 is smaller than it looked, and wider.** `announcementOf(event)`
(`announcer.ts:54-69`) already receives the whole event, the fallback event
carries `call: 1 | 2 | 3` (`src/shared/view-driver.ts:28`), and `FALLBACK_CLASS`
(`fallback-notice.ts:16-20`) already maps call → severity. **No signature change
and no `announce()` call-site edits** — `announcer.ts:29` becomes a three-way map
keyed off `event.call` at `:60-61`. Four literals carry the fatal string:
`fallback-notice.ts:28`, `announcer.ts:29`,
`src/client/driver/fixtures/woodari-run03.ts:95` (a fifth variant with a tail,
which the e2e suite drives), and `tests/windows/live-feed.test.ts:262`.

New register — a **transmission** fault, never a reasoning or gate one:
`회신 불량` · `네트워크 지연 중` · `서버 이상 — 요원과 재접선 시도 중`. One line per
severity. A stretch where the radio was down is also a stretch where the agent
judged alone, and the report for it can say so.

**G3 is not a guard change.** `report-archive.ts:34` is `REFUSED = /gate|게이트/i`
— a deny list `ECHO-n` passes, and it is what keeps invariant 6. The on-screen
label is built by `runLabelOf(entry.run)` (`:43-45`) from the run **number**; the
entry's own label is never consulted for it. In-file: `runLabelOf` (`:43-45`),
`OWN_PREFIX` (`:31`), `RAIL_LABEL`/`RAIL_NOTE` (`:37`, `:40`),
`ArchiveSegment.runLabel` (`:25`) and its render site (`:152`).

The labels `OWN_PREFIX` exists to strip are minted at
`src/client/driver/fixtures/woodari-meta.ts:24-25` and
`src/client/driver/fixtures/run-loop.ts:82`. **Five further live `RUN nn` sites
sit outside `report-archive.ts`** — `src/client/shell/announcer.ts:26`
(`RUN_OPENED`, the spoken label on every `meta`),
`src/client/windows/tally.ts:54` (`RUN_CAPTION`, written at `:172,176`,
announced at `:173,179,324`), `src/client/components/run-counter.ts:27`, and
`src/client/components/deploy-button.ts:51`. Rename in the archive only and the
toast and the ledger still say `RUN nn`. Asserted across seven suites, including
`tests/windows/reports.test.ts:441-466` and
`tests/fixtures/meta-and-archive.test.ts:17,79` — the PRD's Scope must enumerate
them and say which are amended.

Archive persistence is U5.1, not this.

**G4 is a rewrite, not a deletion.** §2 행동 원칙 is the only place the player
reads who their agent is. Same information as a person — *"확인되지 않은 것을
단정하지 않는다. 판단이 필요한 순간에는 판단하고, 왜 그랬는지 남긴다."* Same cost.
`tests/windows/agent-file.test.ts:270` asserts the current title.

### T — Text volume

| id | item | resolution | depends on | landed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | BLOCK STORE duplicates report sentences | remove the window; its one distinct function — a cross-run view of mined sentences — moves into the report | U5.2a | #181 |
| T2 | Radio reports too long to read before the next event | lower `max_chars` in `data/policy/report-guidance.json:11` (300–1200자, character-bounded; rendered by `src/shared/report-guidance.ts:49-56`) | — | #158 · #172 |
| T3 | Layout: REPORTS left (large), LIVE FEED top-right, AGENT FILE bottom-right | `src/client/shell/layout.ts:33,50,78-95` | M | **no** |

**T1's sites:** `src/client/windows/block-store.ts` (deleted),
`src/client/shell/window-registry.ts:12,40` (the import and the mount — its
header says it is the only module that imports `windows/`),
`src/client/shell/layout.ts:33` (`WINDOW_KEYS` `'store'`), `:50` (`DESK_ORDER`),
`:107` (its rect), `src/client/styles/win-block-store.css`, and
`src/client/components/species-filter.ts`, whose only importer it is.

**T3 must move `DESK_ORDER` (`layout.ts:50`) with the rects**, or a
`DESK_ORDER`/`applyLayout` mismatch reopens the WCAG 2.4.3 focus-order defect
`e2e/a11y.spec.ts` once quarantined. That quarantine is **lifted** — the assert
compares tab order to the rects row-major with a 24 px row tolerance, so a
mismatch is a real red now rather than an expected failure.

**T1 does not do T3, and reading it as though it had is a mistake this document
has already made once.** T1 removes a window: `WINDOW_KEYS` and `DESK_ORDER`
shrink to three, the columns return to full desk height, and the two
≥4-distinct-origin floors (`tests/shell/apply-layout.test.ts:104`,
`e2e/shell.spec.ts:359`) drop to 3 — which T1 must do, or T3 fails them later.
That is a **smaller desk of the same shape**, not T3's shape.

What ships today is three side-by-side full-height columns — LIVE FEED
(`COL_A_RATIO` .265) · REPORTS (`COL_B_RATIO` .395) · AGENT FILE (the
remainder). T3 is a **two-column desk**: REPORTS large on the left, with the
right column split horizontally into LIVE FEED above and AGENT FILE below. No
part of that exists. `applyLayout` returns three rects at one `y`, and T3 needs
two `y` values and a vertical split ratio the file has no constant for.

Why it matters, in the terms this document ranks by: REPORTS is where mining
happens and where U5.2c will render cause, and it is currently the middle of
three narrow columns — the smallest surface the most-read window could have.
LIVE FEED is a ticker that is watched, not read closely, and it holds the
widest column of the three.

The prose is a separate, smaller defect and rides with it: `layout.ts`'s header
still narrates five windows, a BLOCK STORE column and a floating TALLY sheet,
and `layout.ts:47`'s "quarantined" wording is stale.

T2 changes what is mineable and the Call-3 latency figure recorded on 08-04.
Re-run one probe after changing it.

### C — Concept and naming

| id | item | where | landed |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | AGENT FILE becomes a paged dossier, not a scroll | `src/client/components/dossier.ts:88-120` (`dossierModel`, six sections §0–§5 in one array); `src/client/windows/agent-file.ts` | **no** |
| C2 | "알고 있는 문장" → **인수인계 사항** (picked 08-06) | `dossier.ts:107` is the only rendered site | #164 |
| C3 | "보고 지침" → **교신 지침** (picked 08-06) | `dossier.ts:113` | #164 |
| C4 | 객관 로그 → 현장 기록, 요원 보고서 → 무전 기록 | `src/client/components/report-view.ts:123` and `:124` | #164 |

- **C1 is not a layout fix, and reading it as one is how it got cut.** "Not a
  scroll" describes the shape, not the reason. The reason is in U5.3's own row,
  which C1 exists to make possible: *flipping back reads past instructions*.
  **The player cannot see what they told a previous agent.** Each sitting they
  compose a file, the day runs on it, and at the close the file is rebuilt for
  the next agent — and the version ECHO-1 flew is then gone from the desk
  entirely. Nothing on screen answers "what did I change between ECHO-2 and
  ECHO-3, and what changed in the result".
  That is the C-BLOCK loop's own comparison surface, and this document ranks by
  mechanism legibility. U5.2c shows which sentence moved *this* agent; without
  C1/U5.3 there is nothing to compare it against, because the previous file
  does not exist anywhere the player can look. **No scroll container fixes
  this** — the pages are not off-screen, they are unwritten.
  A paged dossier is what gives a sitting somewhere to live: §0–§5 become a
  page, and U5.3 appends one per ECHO-n. Cost is real and stays named — section
  order is asserted at `tests/windows/agent-file.test.ts:262-274` and
  `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts:129-139`, and the deployed set per sitting has to be
  retained to fill a past page — but it is cost against the tiebreaker, not
  against polish.
  *(Cut from the first cut line onward with no reason ever recorded, and
  re-read on 08-08 as an overflow fix, which it is not. 민서 corrected it the
  same day; it is group 6 in §3.)*
- **C1's page inventory uses spaced forms on disk** — `행동 원칙`, `알고 있는 문장`,
  `보고 지침`. `문서번호` **does not exist anywhere in the tree**; it is new copy to
  be authored. `문서번호` and `호출부호` are built in the window, not the component
  (`agent-file.ts:76`, `:95`). Section order is asserted at
  `tests/windows/agent-file.test.ts:262-274` and `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts:129-139`.
- **C2's second anchor is a comment.** `slot-board.ts:1` is a source header
  (`// SlotBoard — §4 알고 있는 문장: …`) — editing it changes nothing on screen.
  Say whether it is kept in step. Test literals: `agent-file.test.ts:272`,
  `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts:137`.
- **C3 must not touch the prompt.** `[보고 지침]` is also the Call-3 prompt header
  at `src/shared/report-guidance.ts:3,7` — a different string, left alone. Tests:
  `agent-file.test.ts:273`, `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts:138`.
- **C4 has a third, player-facing site.** `src/engine/index.ts:175`
  `SUBSTITUTE_REPORT_BODY = '보고를 생성하지 못했다. 이 라운드의 기록은 객관 로그로
  남는다.'` — used at `:363` as the body the player reads when Call 3 fails. Also
  decide the non-rendered fixture fields `src: '객관 로그'`
  (`src/client/driver/fixtures/woodari-meta.ts:50,52,53,54,57`).

C2–C4 are copy and land in one commit.

### U — Usability

| id | item | resolution | landed |
|---|---|---|---|
| U1 | LIVE FEED emits many lines at once, so time stutters instead of passing | reveal queue in `src/client/windows/live-feed.ts`, downstream of the adapter's fanout (`adapter.ts:155-158`) | #169 · #171 |
| U2 | 4 slots too few; drag sentences rather than cards | `SLOT_CAP` at `src/client/components/slot-board.ts:19`; a U-owned §9 parameter (`docs/spec-client.md:149,380,405`), not a datapack field | **no** |
| U3 | Remove TALLY; merge NEW RUN into DEPLOY; casualties and results in 현장 기록 as unmineable, visually distinct records | see below — the sites span four files | #174 |
| U4 | Nothing tells a judge what to press first | resolved into O1 and O2 | — |
| U5.1 | REPORTS tabs → ECHO-1, ECHO-2…, each opening that sitting's 현장 기록 + 무전 기록 | needs a **new store** — see below | **no** |
| U5.2a | the slotted highlight was written and never rendered | `src/client/components/minable-sentence.ts:55-74`, `src/client/windows/reports.ts:108-132`, `src/client/styles/win-reports.css:75-77` | `afe02d6` |
| U5.2b | Carry the agent's chosen stance to the client at all | engine seam — see below | #160 |
| U5.2b+ | Carry the **citation** with it: `judged.cited_ids`, the judgment's `because_block_ids` filtered to what the player deployed | second engine-seam unit; §5.2's authored/engine/client split applies twice here | #178 |
| U5.2c | Show that stance beside the sentence that moved it, and show unused sentences as unused | depends on U5.2b+ — see below | **no** |
| U5.3 | AGENT FILE gains one page per ECHO-*; a new simulation appends a page, **and flipping back reads past instructions** | depends on C1 (`dossier.ts:88-120`); needs the deployed set retained per sitting | **no** |
| U6 | The loop the player operates: one sitting is one record, one gesture mines, one press deploys | five units — see below | #186 · #187 · #190 · #191 · #194 |

**U1 must not go in the adapter.** A pacing queue already exists there —
`adapter.ts:117` (`Pending`), `:160-166` (`absorb`), `:169-186` (`release`) — and
events release when `clock.minute` reaches their stamp, which is why same-minute
lines burst. But `kick()` (`:194-196`) returns early while `pending` is non-empty,
so a reveal delay added there **stalls the engine's next `step()` and the
prefetch — the run halts.** The queue belongs in the feed window, downstream of
`fanout`. Agent-log timestamps are engine data (`adapter.ts:111-115` `stampOf()`
reads `event.line.clock`; the same events feed `tools/driver/run/bind.mjs:128-130`)
and are never edited for pacing.

For 26 deaths to land at 21:04 the player has to have been there for the twelve
hours those people were alive. Pace can carry tension too — slow in quiet
stretches, quick when events crowd.

**U3's sites**, none of which the previous ranges covered:
`src/client/windows/tally.ts:45-48` (the NEW RUN strings, written at `:370`),
`:126-132` (construction), `:181` (re-enable), `:196-210` (the click handler that
actually sends at `:204`); `src/client/driver/live/adapter.ts:367-404` — the whole
`send`, with `:379` the `deploy` op being merged into and `:386-402` the `new_run`
guard; `src/client/components/deploy-button.ts:15-108` (the notes and
`DeployView`/`DeployState` a merged control must extend, through the stamp's
render at `:102-107`); and **`src/client/shell/window-registry.ts:42`, which is
what mounts TALLY** — leave it and the window still appears. Also
`layout.ts:33,50,75-80,100-102,109`, and a decision on whether `RunPhase 'tally'`
(`run-state.ts:23`, set at `:112-128`) stays.

**U2 is pinned by four assertions the executor will hit:**
`tests/windows/block-store.test.ts:366` (`expect(SLOT_CAP).toBe(4)`),
`tests/windows/agent-file.test.ts:734` (source regex),
`agent-file.test.ts:735-740` (forbids any other u4 source matching
`/(?:slotCap|cap|slots?)\s*[:=]\s*4\b/`), and
`tests/windows/block-store.test.ts:557-559`, which requires
`git diff --name-only HEAD -- slot-board.ts` to be **empty** — any uncommitted
edit to `slot-board.ts` fails it. That last one also catches C2.

The mechanism risk stands: C-BLOCK was measured with **one** sentence injected
into `[알려진 것]` (9/10 stance shift, one-sided Fisher p=0.0000595). At ten the
effect may dilute or saturate and attribution may be lost, which is the
legibility the loop depends on. Raise to 6 behind one probe arm, or hold at 4.

**U6 is the loop itself, and it is five units.** Each is small; together they
are what a sitting *is*. `W1` the resume carries a build stamp, so a stale tab
is not mistaken for a live sitting. `W2` one sitting is one accumulating
record — `reports.ts` keys documents by RUN and appends rounds, and the
run/round keyspace collision in `railEntries` dies with it. `W3` mining is one
gesture: a second activation seats the sentence rather than requiring a
separate drag. `W4` one DEPLOY, phase-gated — the file is locked while the day
runs, handed back at the close so the day's own report can be mined into the
file it was written for, and one press commits it and opens the next day. `R1`
the record breaks a line between rounds, which W2 made necessary by putting
them in one document.

**W4's op order is load-bearing, and so is where the file is re-armed.**
`deploy` must reach the **closing** run's membrane, because that is what
`live/adapter.ts` `closingState()` harvests into `carried`; sent after
`new_run` it names the new day and the committed file never carries. And the
carried file has to be replayed into the opened run as real `slot`/`deploy`
ops, not assigned into the adapter's view mirror: `createMembrane` is per bound
run (`live-driver.ts:87`), so a mirror-only re-arm leaves the new day with an
empty seat map — `unslot` answers `empty_slot` and `membrane.deployed()`, which
is what `composer.judgment` carries into Call 1, is empty. The fixture loop's
`carry()` has always replayed ops; the live path must match it.

**The fixture hides this whole class of defect.** `e2e/` drives the DEV fixture
loop, whose store is one flat object that survives `new_run`, while the live
path rebuilds per day. Any unit that changes what crosses a run boundary is
therefore proved at the driver seam under vitest, never in the browser, and its
Done-when says so.

**U5.1 cannot extend `report_archive`.** `src/runloop/meta-state.ts:22` is
`report_archive: string[]` — run **ids**, an index for browsing, appended at
`run-loop.ts:118-119` and surfaced as `archive: {run,label}[]` at `:131`. Report
bodies are persisted nowhere, and `data/runs/_schema/meta-state.schema.json` is
`{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}` under `additionalProperties: false`,
so widening it fails `tests/runloop/meta-schema.test.ts:88-89`. This unit adds a
separate store. `docs/spec-client.md:152` already specifies the rail (and `:305`
the component), so it is conformance, not a new feature. **Its client half is
U6's `W2`** — the rail is already keyed by sitting — so what is left here is the
persistence alone, which is the part no player sees.

**U5.2b is an engine-seam unit, not a client one.** The prose exists on disk and
dies before the client: `gates.json`'s `stances[].desc` (G1 stance `c` 경청 =
*"질문지를 덮는다 — 발신자의 말이 끝날 때까지 끊지 않고 자리를 내준다"*) is
**dropped at `src/engine/beat/schedule.ts:109`**, where `compileGate` maps
stances to `{ id, label }` only; `Stance` is `{ id: string; label: string }`
(`src/shared/contracts.ts:24`); and **no `ViewEvent` carries a stance at all**.
An executor told "use `desc`" finds no `desc` and reaches for `label` — exactly
what U5.2c forbids. This unit widens `Stance`, stops dropping `desc` in
`compileGate`, and adds the field to the §5.2 view-driver seam.

**U5.2c** renders it. Use `desc`, never `label`: `매뉴얼 → 경청` transmits nothing,
because the player has never seen either word. Sentences that fired nothing must
read as unused, or the player cannot learn which one worked — this is also how a
false lead surfaces without the game saying "wrong". **The false leads that ship
are `data/scenario/우는다리/gates.json`'s `gates[].false_leads`** — 7 strings, one
per gate. `truths.json` never ships (`vite.config.ts:38`) and `truths` is a banned
seam prefix (`src/shared/seam-keys.ts:36`).

**"Unused" needs a source, and that source is U5.2b+.** `judged` carries
`{stance_id, desc}` only; `because_block_ids` is a required field of the live
judgment response (`contracts.ts:118`, enforced by the proxy schema at
`proxy/src/calls.ts`) and dies at `engine/index.ts:336-337`, where
`submitStance` returns neither. U5.2b+ widens both with `cited_ids` — the
citation filtered to ids the player actually deployed — so unused is
*slotted-but-not-cited*, computed against the round's slotted set rather than
guessed. `MarkSets` (`minable-sentence.ts:23-26`) is sets of ids, and "unused"
is a new state beside `mined`/`slotted`/`carried`. U5.2c renders into the
per-sitting document U6's `W2` built, so it is re-authored against that shape,
not against the one-round document this row was first written for.

### O — Opening

| id | item | where | landed |
|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | Play the 08:50 call before the desk appears: empty screen, radio only, then it cuts off and the windows come up | `src/client/main.ts:9` (`void bootShell()`), or between `boot.ts:118` (`holdDesk`) and `:216-219` (`revealDesk`) — the hold/reveal seam exists at `src/client/components/desktop-dressing.ts:15,20` | #175 |
| O2 | First report's first mineable sentence pulses once, first run only | `src/client/components/minable-sentence.ts:20,78-82,121-126` for the state; first-arrival is decided at `src/client/windows/reports.ts:95-108` / `report-view.ts:94` (`RenderOptions.replay`); new class beside `win-reports.css:75-77`, values in `tokens.css` (invariant 8) | **dropped** |
| O3 | Three or four sound effects — static, the phone, the silence at 21:04 | files under `public/assets/`; entry per file in `assets-manifest.json`'s `assets[]` — generated `{file, tool, prompt, license}`, sourced `{file, source, license, note}` (see the font entries) | #179 |

An opening is not a tutorial. Ten seconds establishes who the player is, what
they are for, and why it is urgent, and it is the first ten seconds of
deliverable #2. CLAUDE.md makes the first 60 seconds the optimization target and
nothing in the build addresses it. O1 must not build a second hold — the desk
already holds and reveals.

### M — Misc

| id | item | where | landed |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Agent callsign increments per simulation (ECHO-1, ECHO-2…) | `dossier.ts:19` (`CALLSIGN = 'ECHO-1'`), consumed at `:92` and `src/client/windows/agent-file.ts:95`; a per-run callsign threads through `DossierInput` (`dossier.ts:35-42`). Other literals: `run-feed.ts:60`, `report-view.ts:124,143` | #166 |
| M2 | Species tags ('자기서술') removed from display, and from the dataset where possible | the literal is `SPECIES_DISPLAY` at `components/block-card.ts:33-38`; the render M2 removes is `:158-161`; the filter prints it twice at `components/species-filter.ts:76,78` | #162 |

- **M1's assertions:** `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts:186`, `tests/windows/live-feed.test.ts:400`.
  M1 is the cheapest piece of U5 — `RUN 01` is a number and reads as "my second
  attempt"; `ECHO-2` is a person, which makes a failed run a dead agent.
- **M2's importer list was wrong.** Only `components/slot-board.ts:16` and
  `windows/block-store.ts:26` import `blockCardModel`, and `block-store.ts:75`
  reads `.species` (data, for the filter) — never `.ko`.
  `components/species-filter.ts:18` imports `SPECIES_DISPLAY` directly;
  `components/deploy-button.ts:10` and `windows/agent-file.ts:16` import `pad2`
  and touch species not at all. Assertions: `agent-file.test.ts:614,632`.
- **The `species` field is data, not decoration.** It is minted from the id
  channel (`src/shared/id.ts:68,91`) off the channel→species map at
  `src/shared/species.ts:43-70` (with `AUTHORED_SPECIES` `:76`, `CERTIFIED` `:79`),
  typed on the wire (`view-driver.ts:17-18`), and set by the engine
  (`src/engine/feed/report.ts:65,71`). The authored `key_conditions[].species` in
  `data/scenario/우는다리/gates.json` is a **separate Korean vocabulary**
  (`사실` | `자기서술`, `datapack.ts:157`) sharing no value with the wire union.
  Display removal is unconditional; field removal is only available if those
  consumers are retired with it.

## 1.5 The prerequisite — mostly landed

The predicate work `status.md` named on 08-05 is **three-quarters done**, and this
document's earlier dependency on it was stale:

- `data/scenario/우는다리/score.json` — **9 units, all 9 carrying predicates**
- `src/driver/scorer.ts:136` — `createScorer` returns a live `ScorerPort`
- both roots wired — `src/client/driver/live/bind.ts:84`, `tools/driver/run/bind.mjs:125`
- **still open:** meter binding — `characters.json` c2–c7, 12 of 14
  `meters[].variable` are `null`

So **U3 and U5.2c are no longer gated on it.**

What remains true is the grammar. A gate's key condition is a five-field record
(`src/shared/datapack.ts:153-158`: `id`, `axis`, `referent`, `species`,
`targets_clause`), authored at `gates.json` `gates[].key_conditions[]` — 9 of them
across 7 gates. `Sentence` is `{ id, text, species, axis? }`
(`src/shared/view-driver.ts:18`) — `axis` is **optional**, and there is **no
`referent`**. So matching a sentence to what it is *for* needs a referent the wire
does not carry. (Not to be confused with `because_referent`,
`src/shared/contracts.ts:113` — the judgment call's field, which is what a grep
for "referent" finds first.)

Across `gates.json` there are exactly two axes — **두려움** (×5) and **지워짐** (×4),
and `temperament.json` carries the same two. The whole scenario reduces to *who is
afraid, and what is being erased*. No surface teaches this; U5.2c and AGENT FILE §4
are where it would show.

## 2. Dependency order

```
G2, G4, C2, C3, C4, M1, M2, T2, U1, U3, O1, O2, O3      ← no dependencies
        │
M1 ──► U5.1                    U5.2b (seam: `desc`) ──► U5.2b+ (seam: `cited_ids`) ──► U5.2c
G3 ──► U5.1                    U6/W2 ──► U5.2c        U6/W2 ──► U5.1
C1 ──► U5.3
        │
U5.2a (landed) ──► T1 ──► T3          U3 ──► T3
U6: W1, W3 ──► W2 ──► W4 ──► R1
U2 ──► probe at the new cap
```

`U5.2a` landing and the scorer landing between them removed both of the previous
graph's long chains. **U3 is now free-standing**, and the critical path is
`U5.2b → U5.2c`, which crosses the engine/client boundary and is therefore two
units by §5.2 — three, once the citation is split out as U5.2b+. T3 trails U3
as well as T1 — its target layout is the three-window desk, which exists only
once TALLY and BLOCK STORE are both gone — so groups 3 and 5 do not swap.

Two kinds of edge live in this graph. A **logic edge** is a real dependency:
the later unit's shape depends on what the earlier one landed. A **file edge**
is a collision — the units are logically independent but touch the same files,
so §5.6's pairwise-disjoint rule forbids sharing a wave and merge order becomes
the dependency. **The REPORTS window is where they converge**:
`windows/reports.ts` · `components/report-view.ts` ·
`components/minable-sentence.ts` · `styles/win-reports.css` and both reports
test files are wanted by U5.2c, U5.1, O2 and U6's `W2`/`R1` alike, and grazed
by T1 and G3. That set is the serial spine; everything else parallelises
around it.

## 3. Work groups

Ordered by what a group unblocks, not by size. The `landed` column in §1 says
what is done; this section says what is next and why it sits where it does.

1. **Copy pass** — G2, G4, C2, C3, C4, M1, M2, T2. Strings and data only.
2. **Time** — U1, then O1. The day has to pass before anything about it reads.
3. **Ending** — U3. Blocks on nothing once the scorer lands.
4. **The loop** — U6: W1 and W3 together, then W2, then W4, then R1. It cuts
   across every other group because it is not a feature but the shape of a
   sitting, and it could only be found by playing the build the groups above
   produced. A loop that dead-ends is worse than a missing feature.
5. **Report becomes the archive** — T1, then T3. T1 removes a window; T3
   re-shapes the desk around what is left, and gives REPORTS the surface the
   mining and the cause both need (§1 T).
6. **The agent's own history** — C1, then U5.3. The player cannot compare this
   sitting against the last one until the previous file exists somewhere on the
   desk. This is the half of the tiebreaker that survives a failed run: a
   citation is read once, a comparison is read every sitting after.
7. **Cause** — U5.2b (seam), U5.2b+ (seam), then U5.2c (render). Crosses the
   engine/client boundary, so it is three units by §5.2 and never one.
8. **History** — G3, then U5.1. G3 gates U5.1 and waits on U3, which reworks
   two of its sites.
9. **Polish** — O3.
10. **Slot cap** — U2, probe first.

**The manual's §1–§4 content is its own row, and it is not polish.** `MANUAL`
(`src/client/shell/manual.ts`) is one swappable object of placeholder copy, and
two of its bodies are already false — they describe a 집계 window U3 deleted and
a two-press day W4 replaced. It is the opening/tutorial conversation 민서
wanted, held against a live screen. It lands after T1 (hard — 보관함 must not be
taught) and prefers T3 (soft — prose can avoid naming positions). What §3–§4
teach is the C-BLOCK loop itself.

**Two items are not being built.** **U2** — raising the slot cap without a probe
risks the mechanism claim: C-BLOCK was measured with **one** injected sentence
(9/10 stance shift, one-sided Fisher p=0.0000595), and at ten the effect may
dilute or saturate, losing exactly the attribution the loop depends on. Raise
to 6 behind one probe arm, or hold at 4. **O2** (the first-mining pulse) shares
all six REPORTS files with U5.2c, so it costs a serial wave on the spine (§2)
to buy one debut animation.

## 4. Cut line — removed (08-08)

Deliberately empty, and deliberately still numbered 4.

This held a Must / Should / Won't table that had to be rewritten after every
wave, which is most of how this document turned into a work log. Order lives in
§3 now, and the two items not being built keep their reasoning at the foot of
it.

The section number stays because **§5 is quoted by number in eighteen committed
PRDs** — 53 references, 21 of them to §5.7 alone, which is the stop rule every
PRD carries verbatim and every executor was instructed to obey by that name.
Renumbering §5 to §4 would mean editing PRDs that are records of what an
executor was actually told, making them say something that was never issued. It
would also be unsafe to do mechanically: `tools/probe/dday-mechanism/suites/*.json`
carries its own `§5.1`, belonging to a different document entirely, so a
repo-wide substitution corrupts the probe record. A numbering gap is the cheaper
mistake, and §1.5 already set the precedent.

## 5. Execution — authoring mini-PRDs for low-cost executors

> As of 2026-08-08 (v15). A PRD names the version it was written against.

The items above are not worked by hand and not worked one at a time. Each is
specified as a **mini-PRD** by a high-capability model, then executed by a
sub-agent on a low-cost model. The specification carries the expertise; the
executor supplies only mechanical edits. Everything here is a rule for the author
of the PRD, not for the executor — with one exception, §5.7, which the author
copies into every PRD.

**Maintaining this section is part of the job.** A high-capability model reading
this document — for any reason — revises §5 when it finds a rule that misfires, a
trap that is missing, or a template field that executors keep filling wrongly, and
bumps the version line. §5 is the only part of this document expected to change
without a playtest behind it.

### 5.1 The division

The author decides. The executor types. Every decision an executor would
otherwise have to make is a decision the PRD failed to make, and a low-cost model
resolves such gaps by inventing something plausible and consistent with nothing.

Author-owned, always resolved before handoff: which files change · the exact final
strings · naming · whether a test is updated or left alone · what counts as done.
Executor-owned: nothing but the edit and running the checks.

The division holds only while the PRD is right. Half the coordinates in this
document carried a defect before the audit, every one of them written
deliberately, so a wrong PRD is the expected case and not the exceptional one.
What follows from that is not that the executor gets discretion back:
**where the PRD does not match the tree, the executor stops.** Stopping is not a
decision, so the division stands — the author decides everything, and where the
author decided wrongly the executor notices and reports rather than repairs.
§5.7 is the block that says so.

### 5.2 Unit sizing

One PRD is one concern, one branch, and a diff a reviewer reads in a sitting.
Split anything that crosses a boundary between authored data, engine, and client —
U5.2b/U5.2c above is exactly that split. The work groups in §3 are the intended
unit boundaries.

Do not hand an executor a unit whose first step is a search. If the PRD cannot
name the file, the PRD is not finished.

### 5.3 What the PRD must contain

```
# <unit id> — <one-line outcome>

## Outcome
One paragraph. What is true when this is done, in player-visible terms.

## Scope
Files this unit may modify — exact paths.
Files this unit must NOT modify, with the reason.
The test files this unit will turn red, and whether each is amended.

## Change list
Per edit: path:line · the exact current text · the exact replacement text.
Verbatim, not described. No regex, no "and similar occurrences".

## Invariants
The rules this unit could break without noticing (§5.4).

## Verification
Commands to run, and the expected result of each.
Observable checks a human repeats in the browser.

## Done when
A checklist of binary conditions. No judgment words.
At least one is behavioural — something the running game does, not an edit made.

## If this PRD is wrong
§5.7, verbatim.
```

Rules for the change list:

- **Open the file and confirm the line does what the citation claims.** A line
  containing the string is not necessarily the line that renders it; a doc comment
  above a function is not the function; a test's name is not its assertion.
- **Follow the value to where it dies.** A field authored in the pack may be
  dropped at a compile step and never reach the client — `stances[].desc` is, at
  `schedule.ts:109`. "It exists on disk" is not "an executor can use it".
- **Ask whether the file runs in the deployed build.** DEV-only fixtures typecheck
  and change nothing on the played site.
- State the replacement text in full, including Korean copy; an executor asked to
  "rename appropriately" invents a register that does not match the fiction.
- Enumerate every site. Accessibility duplicates, DEV fixtures and test literals
  all carry copies of UI strings.
- Where the change is a deletion, say what replaces it, including "nothing".
- **Cite a multi-line block by its first line.** Two PRDs cited a block by its
  last line; under §5.7 the executor then stops at the first edit, having done
  nothing. First line, always. (v8 — #152/#153 review.)
- **Sweep the test files' shadow types.** A suite that imports its subject
  dynamically declares a private mirror of that subject's interfaces; `tsc`
  reads the mirror and `vitest` does not, so widening a type in `src/` leaves
  the suite green while `npm run check` fails. Grep for `interface <TypeName>`
  in the test files before handing over. (v14 — R1.)
- **Read every Done-when grep against the replacement text, not the tree.** A
  condition that demands a string be absent while the change list deliberately
  introduces it can never go true, however correctly the unit is executed.
  (v14 — T3.)
- **An absence check greps the CALL FORM, and copies the guard's own regex.**
  The rule above was already written when the same author broke it three times
  in one session — `data-block-id` and `Math.max` in g13-4, `padStart` in
  g15-1 — every time in the same shape: the change list writes the banned token
  into a comment *explaining why it is not being used*, and the Done-when then
  greps for the bare token. Stating the principle has not been enough, so the
  mechanical form replaces it: where a condition exists because a test guards
  against something, **open that test, copy the regex it actually scans with,
  and make that the Done-when.** `no-digit-npc.test.ts:177` scans
  `/\b(toFixed|toLocaleString|padStart)\s*\(/`; the Done-when greps for exactly
  that, not for `padStart`. A condition that does not match its guard is not a
  weaker check, it is a different one. (v15 — g13-4, g15-1.)
- **Scope a Done-when grep to the unit's files.** A repo-wide grep meets
  grandfathered sites and test comments — `published-data.test.ts:144` carries
  `객관 로그` in a comment forever — and then a binary condition can never go
  true. (v8.)
- **Every line number cites the stamped tree, and same-file edits are listed
  bottom-up.** An earlier edit in the same file moves every line below it; a
  citation read off a mid-application tree is wrong for the executor, who
  checks against the un-edited file. Bottom-up ordering keeps every row's
  line true at its turn; where the order must be top-down, the row says so
  and states the drift. (v10 — g1-2's E5 cited `:401` from a scratch tree
  where two earlier edits had already landed; the executor correctly stopped
  at `:399`.)

### 5.4 Repo traps to name in the PRD that touches them

- **Structure tests assert against the working tree, not file history.**
  `tests/windows/block-store.test.ts:561-567` requires `git diff -U0 HEAD --
  block-card.ts` to contain no `-` lines. Two siblings are a *different* shape —
  `agent-file.test.ts:723,729` and `block-store.test.ts:557-559` assert
  `git diff --name-only HEAD -- <file>` is **empty**, so they fail on any edit at
  all (`block-store.test.ts:557` guards `slot-board.ts`, which C2 and U2 both
  touch). **All of them are emptied by committing**, so only *uncommitted* work is
  caught. A PRD for deletion- or rename-shaped work must decide whether the
  assertion is amended, and fix whether verification runs before or after the
  commit.
- **A merge can commit a file nobody edited.** Anything untracked in the working
  tree when a conflict is resolved is swept into the merge commit — two scenario
  drafts reached this branch that way and left again in `e68d09d`. An executor
  resolving a merge stages by path and never `git add -A`; `git rm --cached` is
  the repair, taking the file off the branch while leaving it on disk. It pairs
  badly with the trap above: committing is what empties those assertions, so a
  merge commit can both hide an edit and add a file in one step.
- **`report-archive.ts`'s label guard is a deny list, and is not the thing to
  change.** `REFUSED = /gate|게이트/i` (`:34`) refuses gate vocabulary only —
  `ECHO-n` passes — and it is what keeps invariant 6. The on-screen label comes
  from `runLabelOf()` (`:43-45`), built from the run number and ignoring the label
  entirely.
- **A test can cover a branch the app cannot reach.** `tests/windows/reports.test.ts:264-278`
  seated a sentence that was slotted but not mined, which the engine forbids, so a
  dead CSS rule stayed green for weeks. When a PRD claims a state renders, it names
  the path that produces it.
- **A queue in the adapter halts the run.** `adapter.ts:194-196` `kick()` returns
  early while `pending` is non-empty; anything held there stops the engine
  stepping. Presentation pacing belongs downstream of `fanout`.
- **Layout is TypeScript, not CSS** (`layout.ts:65-111`), and `DESK_ORDER`
  (`:50`) must move with the rects or focus order regresses (WCAG 2.4.3).
- **`window-registry.ts` is the only module that imports `windows/`.** Removing a
  window means removing its registry row, or it still mounts.
- **Species derives from the id channel, never from classification**
  (`docs/spec-client.md` §5.2). The field is data; only its display is cosmetic.
- **The scenario is replaceable; the client must not learn 우는다리.** The game
  has to keep running when `write-scenario` produces a different pack. Scenario
  content reaches code only as data: clocks from `meta.json` through `pack.ts`,
  stance prose and false leads from the pack through the seam, score labels from
  the `score` event's rows. Frame copy (요원 · 무전 · 상황실 · ECHO-n) is
  game-owned and fine. Scenario literals already in the tree are grandfathered
  where they sit — a unit that rebuilds a surface does not mint new ones, and
  where the seam already carries the value as data, it reads the data. DEV
  fixtures are exempt: scenario-bound by nature, and they never ship
  (`run-loop.ts:176-177`).
- **`dist/` is a player surface.** Anything published is fetchable by URL, so the
  gate invariant applies to the pack as shipped. `publishedContentOf()`
  (`vite.config.ts:159-164`) strips design-only fields from `gates.json`,
  `score.json` **and `characters.json`**, and the build plugin and both guards
  call that one function, so no test can pass on bytes the deploy does not ship.
  `tests/scaffold/published-data.test.ts` holds all three strips to a
  no-consumer premise — `(g)`, `(h)`, `(i)` — and `no-gate-vocab.test.ts` scans
  every published string value at any depth. A PRD that adds a field to a pack
  decides whether it ships, and adds it to the strip and its premise check if
  not.
- **`button()` names a control through `title`, never `aria-label`**
  (`src/client/shell/dom.ts:28-33`) — and while visible text exists, the text is
  the accessible name and `title` is ignored; remove the text and `title` takes
  over. The a11y census reads `aria-label ?? title ?? textContent`. (v8.)
- **The dark shell types in `--txt-*`; `--pap-*` is ink for paper** — the two
  meet at ~1.3:1 on `--ink-0`, which is invisible. Shell overlays slot into an
  existing z ladder: `#grain` 900 · `#vignette` 901 · `#sweep` 902 · `#toast`
  950 · `.skip-link` 960. (v8.)
- **Two composition roots** must stay in step: `src/client/driver/live/bind.ts`
  and `tools/driver/run/bind.mjs`.
- **The membrane rule and invariant 6** (/CLAUDE.md, `docs/spec-client.md:113-115`)
  outrank any instruction in a PRD.

### 5.5 Verification

`npm run check` is the **type-and-data gate** — `tsc -p tsconfig.core.json` · `tsc`
· `typecheck:test` · `datapack:check` · **`datapack:lint:all`**
· `test:shared` (`node --test` over `tools/tests/*.mjs`). The lint step is what a
data edit (G1b, T2) trips. It named one slug until 08-08, which meant a second
pack landed with no gate at all; it now enumerates `data/scenario/` so the gate
covers a pack the day the pack exists.

**`check` does not run vitest.** Every vitest suite, including every structure test
in §5.4, runs only under `npm run test`. `npm run build` adds the Vite build and is
the only way to see what actually ships.

Client-facing units name all three. A unit that changes what reaches the browser
names `npm run build` and an inspection of `dist/`. A PRD whose verification is
only "it looks right" is not ready to hand over.

**One known intermittent red.** `tests/fixtures/dev-only.test.ts`'s
`(d) if a build exists, no fixture string reached it` failed twice in six full
runs on 08-06, then survived nine more — three of them after a fresh
`npm run build` — and has never failed in isolation.
`tests/assets/no-third-party-url.test.ts:81-82` removes `dist/` and rebuilds it
in `beforeAll` while `(d)` is scanning `dist/`, and that file's own comment
already records the two going red order-dependently inside a full run. The
`NODE_ENV` pin there addressed a stale dev-flavoured `dist/`; the delete-and-
rebuild race is untouched by it.

Not diagnosed, and stated as observed rather than explained: the failure is a
non-empty `hits`, which a partial read of a half-written `dist/` does not
obviously produce. Whoever fixes it captures the hit string first.

The rule for a PRD, which is narrow on purpose: a red in `(d)` **alone**, on a
unit that touched neither `dist/` nor `tests/fixtures/`, is re-run once before
it is reported, and is never repaired by the executor. Every other red goes back
under §5.7 unchanged. "Re-run it" is not a general licence — it applies to this
one test id and no other.

### 5.6 Handoff — the orchestrated pipeline (08-07, replacing the session relay)

The g2-1 pilot replaced the original handoff (separate executor sessions,
docs-PRs for stamps, stop-reports relayed by hand) with a single orchestrated
flow. The author fires the executor directly as a Sonnet-class subagent and
stays in the loop:

1. **Author** writes the PRD lean — a three-line header (plan version · the
   tree sha the citations bind to · branch · commit message) and the body
   sections of §5.3. No decision logs, dates, or attributions in the PRD:
   that history lives in git and the PR thread.
2. **Stamp** immediately before firing: every `path:line · current text` row
   re-verified against the sha in the header, same-file edits listed bottom-up
   (or the drift stated), the reference data files a suite *loads* swept along
   with suite sources (the g1-1 provenance stop), and the full change list
   **dry-run** on a scratch tree — apply, run the suites, revert (the g1-2 e2e
   catch and the g4-1 `BeatCursor` catch both came from dry runs, not from
   reading). G3, T3 and U5.2c get a re-authoring pass instead of a mechanical
   stamp, because their shape depends on what U3, T1 and U5.2b landed. The
   full apply-run-revert dry-run of the relay era is no longer mandatory: a
   stop now costs minutes, not a docs-PR cycle, and the g2-1 pilot showed a
   scratch dry-run can pass by environmental luck while the executor's own
   full-suite run finds the truth. The stamp keeps the cheap checks (line
   verification, loaded-data sweep, type-plausibility of new signatures); the
   full-suite proof belongs to the executor's verification and the author's
   re-verify.
3. **Executor** — one Sonnet subagent per PRD, in its own git worktree on the
   unit's branch. It executes the change list literally, runs the PRD's
   verification, and commits **one code commit**. It pushes nothing and opens
   no PR. §5.7's stop rule overrides everything: a stop-report returns to the
   author in-conversation (minutes, not a docs-PR cycle), and the author fixes
   the PRD and re-fires — the citations cannot go stale in between, because
   execution happens on the tree the stamp just verified.
4. **Author verifies**: diff against the change list row by row, full suites,
   and a local merge preview against then-current `main`. PRD amendments land
   as author commits on the same branch. The author pushes and opens **one PR
   per wave** with the grouped commits — code and the decisions that produced
   it reviewed together, by 윤석; merges are 민서's, one at a time, in the
   wave's stated order. `main` stays deployable, and repo hard rules 1–6 apply
   to subagent commits exactly as to hand-written ones.

   **The wave PR carries its own PRDs** (v14). The wave branch opens with a
   docs commit holding every PRD it is about to execute, and the unit branches
   fork from *that*, so each decision is reviewed beside the diff that
   implements it. This is sound only while the wave's units are pairwise
   file-disjoint — which the rule below already demands — because that is what
   lets a unit that goes red be left out of the wave branch and shipped after
   rather than holding the others. A hotfix that must reach `main` first still
   opens alone; nothing here outranks hard rule 3.

Execution stays **wave-parallel, merge-serial**. Units whose files are
pairwise disjoint develop concurrently, one worktree each; a unit whose
stamped rows cite another unit's *output* waits for that unit's **merge** —
stacking branches is not used (see the #153 stranding). Before each merge the
author re-runs the PR's suite on a local merge preview. Playtest cadence
follows waves; feel values flagged in a PR are checked at that wave's game
check.

### 5.7 When the PRD is wrong

A PRD fails in three shapes, and only two of them are visible to the executor.

- **The citation does not match.** The change list says a path and line hold a
  string; they do not. §5.3's verbatim rule is what makes this fail loudly. The
  danger is the recovery: a low-cost model's default is to search for the string
  elsewhere and edit what it finds — the first step §5.2 forbids, arriving through
  the author's error instead of the author's omission.
- **The instruction is executable and wrong.** A PRD that said "render
  `stances[].desc`" would send an executor looking for a field that dies at
  `schedule.ts:109`; finding none, it reaches for `label`, which is the one thing
  U5.2c forbids. The executor is not malfunctioning. In the absence of the named
  value, being helpful *is* inventing.
- **The instruction is executable and breaks something.** U1 built into the
  adapter applies cleanly, typechecks, and passes every suite, because
  `kick()`'s early return at `adapter.ts:194-196` halts the run at runtime. No
  stop rule reaches this one — the executor was never confused. It is caught only
  by a Done-when condition stated as behaviour ("the run reaches 21:04"), which is
  why §5.3 requires one.

The block below goes in every PRD, verbatim, under `## If this PRD is wrong`.

```
An edit whose stated current text is not at the cited path and line is a defect
in this document, not a puzzle to solve. Do not search for the text elsewhere.
Do not adapt the edit to what you find. Do not skip ahead to the next edit.

Stop at the first mismatch and report:
  - the edits that applied, by path:line
  - the edit that did not, with the text actually present at that path and line
  - the commit you are working from: `git log -1 --format=%h`

Change nothing further, and open no PR. A report of this kind is a completed
run, not a failed one.
```

The last line is load-bearing. An executor that reads stopping as failure pushes
through, and the failure that reaches the author is a diff instead of a sentence.

On receiving such a report the author separates two causes, because the fixes
differ: the PRD was wrong when written (correct it and reissue), or the branch
moved under it (rebase and reissue against the reported commit). The executor
cannot tell these apart; the reported commit is what lets the author. Either way
the reissue is the committed file (§5.6), never a correction in chat.
