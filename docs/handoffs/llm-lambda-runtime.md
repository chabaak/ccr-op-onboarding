# Apothecary Lambda/Bedrock Production Runbook

This is the operating guide for the Apothecary dialogue Lambda. For the API
contract and implementation map, see
[`planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer/README.md`](../../planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer/README.md).

## Runtime

```text
GitHub Pages
  -> API Gateway HTTP API
  -> Node.js 24 Lambda
  -> Amazon Bedrock Converse
```

The public API has exactly two routes:

- `POST /ai/dialogue`: return one validated NPC line and four choices.
- `GET /ai/health`: report capabilities without invoking Bedrock.

Portraits are pre-generated assets. There is no runtime image generation,
session store, streaming endpoint, or player free-text input UI. The customer
identity in a request is registry-checked, but `history[].npcLine`,
`history[].playerChoiceLabel`, and `availableClues[].text` are client-supplied
strings bounded only by length and count, and they reach the prompt verbatim —
an accepted, mitigated residual risk, not an absence of free text. See the
validation boundary in [`llm-layer.md`](../../planning/handoffs/llm-layer.md).

## Production inventory

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| AWS account | `141840355276` |
| Region | `ap-northeast-2` |
| Local CLI profile | `nhn-game` |
| Application stack | `nhn-game-llm-layer` |
| Bootstrap stack | `nhn-game-github-actions` |
| API ID | `zcyeajmv11` |
| Lambda | `nhn-game-llm-layer-turn` |
| Active model | `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` |
| Allowed Origin | `https://chabaak.github.io` |
| GitHub deploy role | `nhn-game-llm-github-deploy` |
| CloudFormation role | `nhn-game-llm-cloudformation-exec` |
| Artifact bucket | `nhn-game-llm-artifacts-141840355276-ap-northeast-2` |
| Lambda logs | `/aws/lambda/nhn-game-llm-layer-turn` |
| API logs | `/aws/apigateway/nhn-game-llm-layer` |

Endpoints:

```text
https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/ai/dialogue
https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/ai/health
```

The Lambda name keeps its historical `-turn` suffix to avoid replacing the
existing CloudFormation resource. The API contract is dialogue-only.

## Guardrails

| Guardrail | Value |
|---|---|
| Model output | 400 tokens |
| Model / API / Lambda timeout | 7 s / 9 s / 10 s |
| Request body | 32 KiB |
| API rate / burst | 1 / 2 |
| Reserved concurrency | `-1` (unset) |
| Emergency kill switch | deploy reserved concurrency `0` |

Lambda validates Origin, content type, body size, registered customer data,
model output, choice verbs, and clue IDs. It invokes Bedrock once with SDK
retries disabled.

Both a validated model result and deterministic fallback return HTTP 200:

- `x-llm-fallback: false`: validated Bedrock output.
- `x-llm-fallback: true`: deterministic server fallback.
- `x-request-id`: request trace ID.

Key infrastructure files:

| Responsibility | File |
|---|---|
| Application stack | `planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer/template.yaml` |
| OIDC roles and artifact bucket | `planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer/deploy/github-actions-bootstrap.yaml` |
| Replacement/deletion protection | `planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer/deploy/application-stack-policy.json` |
| CI/CD | `.github/workflows/llm-layer.yml` |

## Local verification

These checks do not require AWS credentials or call Bedrock:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer"
npm ci
npm run check
npm run sam:validate
npm run bootstrap:validate
npm run sam:build
npm run sam:smoke
```

Authenticate only for local AWS operations:

```bash
aws sso login --profile nhn-game --use-device-code
npm run aws:preflight
```

Always use the `nhn-game` profile. The underlying SSO session name is
machine-local.

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/llm-layer.yml` behaves as follows:

- Pull requests to `main`: test, validate, build, and bundle smoke only.
- Relevant pushes to `main`: verify, deploy the application stack, then run
  the production smoke test.
- `workflow_dispatch`: deploys only when run from `main`.

The deploy job builds before assuming `nhn-game-llm-github-deploy`, verifies
account `141840355276`, uploads artifacts under the commit SHA, and delegates
the stack update to `nhn-game-llm-cloudformation-exec`.

The OIDC trust is limited to this immutable repository identity and `main`:

```text
repo:alstjgg@26458319/nhn-game-2026@1306590172:ref:refs/heads/main
```

Deployments share concurrency group `nhn-game-llm-layer-production` and are not
cancelled in progress. The workflow validates the stack outputs and runs health,
live dialogue, CORS, body-limit, and CloudWatch telemetry checks after deploy.

### Manual application deployment

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer"
aws sso login --profile nhn-game --use-device-code
npm run aws:preflight
npm run check
npm run sam:validate
npm run sam:build
sam deploy --profile nhn-game
```

`samconfig.toml` supplies the stack, region, parameters, artifact bucket, and
CloudFormation execution role. Review the change set before approval.

Expected changes are limited to existing Lambda code/configuration, API
routes/integrations/permissions, the active `ModelId`, log retention, and
throttling. Stop for an unexpected resource, public endpoint, IAM wildcard,
or protected-resource replacement/deletion.

`ModelId` is a Lambda environment variable and deploys on this path.
`AllowedProfileMode` is not: it rewrites the execution role's inline policy and
requires the elevated path below.

### Bootstrap deployment

The separate bootstrap stack owns the OIDC provider, deployment roles, and
artifact bucket. Update it only with local SSO:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer"
aws sso login --profile nhn-game --use-device-code
npm run aws:preflight
npm run bootstrap:validate

aws cloudformation deploy \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  --stack-name nhn-game-github-actions \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --template-file deploy/github-actions-bootstrap.yaml
```

### Verifying the application stack policy

Nothing verified for a while that the replacement/deletion policy was actually
attached to the live stack — `bootstrap:validate` only parses the JSON. The
deploy workflow now carries a post-deploy check for it, **commented out**, because
the deploy role needs `cloudformation:GetStackPolicy` first. That grant is already
in `deploy/github-actions-bootstrap.yaml`; it reaches the account only through the
bootstrap deployment above.

To activate, in this order:

1. Deploy the bootstrap stack with local SSO (previous section).
2. Confirm the grant landed:

```bash
aws cloudformation get-stack-policy \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  --stack-name nhn-game-llm-layer \
  --query StackPolicyBody --output text
```

3. Uncomment the "Verify the application stack policy is attached" step in
   `.github/workflows/llm-layer.yml` and merge.

Enabling it before step 1 makes every deploy fail with `AccessDenied`. The check
is read-only by design: `cloudformation:SetStackPolicy` is deliberately not
granted, since it could also remove the protection.

Restore the application stack policy if it is ever removed:

```bash
aws cloudformation set-stack-policy \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  --stack-name nhn-game-llm-layer \
  --stack-policy-body file://deploy/application-stack-policy.json
```

IAM creation/mutation and protected-resource replacement are outside the
automatic application deployment path.

### Narrowing the Bedrock model allowlist

`AllowedProfileMode` controls which Bedrock inference profiles the execution
role may invoke. It stays `both` while the operating-model decision is open —
see "Open decision — model selection" in
[`planning/research/llm-backend-aws-bedrock.md`](../../planning/research/llm-backend-aws-bedrock.md). Narrow it
once that decision is recorded.

Changing it rewrites the inline policy on `LlmExecutionRole`, so CloudFormation
calls `iam:PutRolePolicy`. `nhn-game-llm-cloudformation-exec` holds only
`iam:GetRole`, `iam:GetRolePolicy`, `iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies`,
`iam:ListRolePolicies`, and `iam:PassRole`, so both GitHub Actions and the
default local deploy fail this change with `AccessDenied`. That restriction is
deliberate: granting the role `iam:PutRolePolicy` over
`role/nhn-game-llm-layer-*` would let anything holding it write an
administrator policy onto a role it can already reach through the Lambda.

Narrow it with the `elevated` samconfig environment, which uses the same stack
and parameters but omits `role_arn`, so the change set runs under the operator's
own SSO identity:

1. Edit `parameter_overrides` in **both** `[default.deploy.parameters]` and
   `[elevated.deploy.parameters]` in `samconfig.toml`, setting
   `AllowedProfileMode` to `nova` or `haiku`. `npm run check` fails if the two
   environments drift; leaving `[default]` on `both` makes the next CI deploy
   replay the old value and fail on the same denial.
2. Confirm `ModelId` names a profile the new mode still allows. The template's
   `SelectedModelMustBeAllowed` rule rejects the change set otherwise.
3. Deploy once with elevated credentials and review the change set. Expect an
   `LlmExecutionRole` policy modification and nothing else:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/planning/legacy-services/apothecary-llm-layer"
aws sso login --profile nhn-game --use-device-code
npm run aws:preflight
npm run check
npm run sam:build
sam deploy --config-env elevated --profile nhn-game
```

4. Verify the surviving permission and that dialogue still runs live:

```bash
aws iam get-role-policy \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --role-name "$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource \
    --profile nhn-game --region ap-northeast-2 \
    --stack-name nhn-game-llm-layer \
    --logical-resource-id LlmExecutionRole \
    --query 'StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId' --output text)" \
  --policy-name InvokeAllowlistedGlobalBedrockProfiles

npm run smoke -- \
  --url https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/ai/dialogue \
  --health-url https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/ai/health \
  --model-id global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0
```

Commit the `samconfig.toml` change. The following CI deploy then produces an
empty change set for this parameter.

## Post-deployment checks

Confirm the live routes:

```bash
aws apigatewayv2 get-routes \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  --api-id zcyeajmv11 \
  --query 'Items[].RouteKey'
```

Read the stack outputs:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  --stack-name nhn-game-llm-layer \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```

Warm the production schema, then verify the endpoint:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=nhn-game npm run warmup -- \
  --model-id global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0

npm run smoke -- \
  --url https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/ai/dialogue \
  --health-url https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/ai/health \
  --model-id global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0
```

Acceptance requires health HTTP 200, all four dialogue verbs,
`x-llm-fallback: false`, the exact allowed Origin, wrong-Origin HTTP 403, and
oversized-body HTTP 413.

Add `--audit-logs --profile nhn-game` for CloudWatch validation. Add
`--check-throttle` only for a deliberate burst test. Never use
`--allow-fallback` as deployment acceptance.

## Operations

- CORS and Origin checks are browser controls, not authentication.
- Bedrock access is limited to inference profiles in the SAM template.
- Logs contain request ID, model, latency, token counts, fallback state, and
  safe error codes only.
- Logs must not contain customer data, hidden causes, prompts, dialogue, clue
  text, or raw model output.
- The artifact bucket blocks public access, requires TLS, and uses encryption
  and versioning.

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| OIDC failure | Bootstrap `TrustedSubject`, repository IDs, and workflow ref |
| Wrong account | `npm run aws:preflight` |
| Health 403 | Request Origin versus `AllowedOrigin` |
| Health timeout | Lambda cold start and API timeout |
| Dialogue fallback | Bedrock access, Lambda IAM, timeout, `fallbackCodes` |
| Dialogue 429 | API rate/burst settings |
| Pages-only failure | CORS preflight and build-time API root |
| Model init failure | `MODEL_ID` versus the deployed allowlist |
| CloudFormation denial | IAM mutation or protected replacement/deletion |
| `iam:PutRolePolicy` denial | `AllowedProfileMode` changed on a non-elevated deploy |

Recent Lambda logs:

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/nhn-game-llm-layer-turn \
  --profile nhn-game \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  --since 10m
```

## Client boundary

The static client receives only the API root at build time:

```text
VITE_PROXY_BASE_URL=https://zcyeajmv11.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com
```

> **Key name.** The root DDAY client reads `VITE_PROXY_BASE_URL`
> (`src/transport/index.ts`, contract-calls §11); nothing sets it yet — see that
> section. `VITE_AI_BASE_URL` is `demos/apothecary/`'s own key and stays that
> demo's — the two stacks are deployed separately and do not share config.

If health or dialogue fails, the client must continue with bundled authored
data. Portraits always use bundled, manifested assets.

For local testing against production AWS, use the loopback-only Vite proxy:

```bash
cd demos/apothecary
npm run dev:lambda -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Do not expose that proxy on `0.0.0.0`. Game wiring and Pages deployment remain
separate from the Lambda infrastructure workflow.
