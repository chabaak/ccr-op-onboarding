## Status (2026-08-10) — x10: six change requests on the first minute a judge sees

Six requests from 민서, verified against the code before any of them was taken as
read, then split into three file-disjoint units and built in parallel in one
worktree. All six shipped. What follows is the record of the four that turned out
to be about something other than what they looked like.

**THE ALERT PLATE'S FOOT WAS TALLER THAN ITS HEAD, on all three plate families.**
`confirm.css` is the shared `.cf-*` template and it is worn by the 배치 확인
confirmation, the onboarding walk and both endings. The foot was
11 + 35 + 18 + a 1px rule = **65px** of answer under a **42px** title, with the
sentence the plate exists for sitting between them: the heaviest band on the plate
was the one carrying the least. Re-cut to **37px**, five under the head.

**And the first cut of it fixed the BAND and not the BUTTON** — 민서, same day,
second pass: 버튼 글자를 줄이고 버튼 높이를 낮춰서 하단 영역에 여백이 생기게 하라.
버튼 안쪽 폭은 너무 넓고 바깥쪽 높이는 여백이 없다. The first cut kept `--fs-9-5` and
a 24px box, proving the type *could* survive the shorter band, and spent the whole
saving on the band — so the button was no smaller than before, only its room was.
Final: 9 + **18** + 9 + 1, same 37px band, with the button 6px shorter, the type at
`--fs-8-5` (10.2px) and half again the air around it. The type shrink was the risk
민서 accepted at the first pass and then asked for outright; the first pass's own
objection to `--fs-8-5` (it is `.cf-note`'s size) is recorded as **overruled**
rather than quietly reversed — at 700 weight on solid seal red beside a 400-weight
caption in `--txt-7`, the answer is not the quieter of the two at equal size.

**`min-width` was never what made those buttons wide.** It dropped 88 → 56px, but on
both one-button plates the per-family `padding:0 var(--space-20)` was doing it: 다음
is 25px of glyphs and sat in a 68px box with 21px of dead air a side while the floor
never came near binding. Both inline paddings went 20 → **12px**, measured on the
built page, and 다음 (25px of glyphs) and 시뮬레이션 시작 (97px) now land within 2px
of the same optical inset — which is what a fixed padding is supposed to buy and did
not. The two feet still declare inline padding and nothing else, enumerated in a
test so neither can fork away from the template by growing a second property.

**THE ONBOARDING IS TWO PLATES AND NEW COPY.** 신규 운영자 안내 → 모의 과정 안내,
with x5c's middle plate (시뮬레이션 대상 — "the first simulation replays the real
incident, watch it") and its third (파견과 재시도) both cut outright rather than
merged. That content is deliberately gone: x8 gave the mechanics to the eight-plate
coach walk, the first run demonstrates the replay **by being** it, and a briefing
that announces it in advance spends the only surprise the opening has. What is left
is the two things a notice has to say before a simulator starts — who the operator
is (load-bearing: that they do *not* go to the scene, the one fact the desk itself
cannot show) and that what follows is a rehearsal with a fixed allotment. The
`n / 2` counter re-counted itself from `MANUAL_STEPS.length` with no edit anywhere.
`최대 3번까지` is arithmetic, not copy — it is `DEFAULT_TOTAL_RUNS - 1`, and a test
fails if the allotment moves without the sentence.

**A GUARD DERIVED A LINE WRAP AND GOT IT BACKWARDS — the one real defect x10
introduced and caught.** The onboarding plate's body is floored at its taller step
so the single button on it cannot move between the two presses. That floor was
derived on paper from the type tokens, and the derivation counted step 2's lead as
two lines on the reasoning that setting `.cf-ask` in `--mono` would wrap it. It does
not: 21 syllables at 1.2em of 18px is ~454px inside 468px of measure — one wrap away
from right, wrong side. `min-height:226px` shipped **31px of dead air on both
plates**, which is the stale `126px` it replaced pointing the other way, on the one
plate whose whole brief was to move the eye off the furniture and onto the middle
text. Measured on the built page with the floor lifted: step 1 is 142px, step 2 is
195px. Floor is 195. The guard is RE-AIMED (C17, logged in `DISCOVERY.md`) to count
one line and the literal was deliberately **not** inlined, so the sheet still goes
red when the type tokens move. Standing lesson: a node-env guard can check every
input to a wrap and never the wrap itself.

**THE WALLPAPER WAS CAPTIONING A CASE THE DESK IS NOT RUNNING.** The `#blueprint`
SVG carried four `<text>` labels naming a bridge — its name, its scale, its
contractor, its anchorages and, in the seal's red, its failure — all of it from the
first scenario concept, while the shipped pack is a tunnel. 민서 named three and
chose to drop the fourth as well. All four gone, every path, both grid patterns,
both fills and the pulsing `.mark` circle untouched; `.bplabel` / `.bplabel.warn`
deleted with them (nothing referenced them, and the one hash baseline that reads
`shell.css` was already re-aimed to u10's range on 08-04). **Nothing in the suite
had ever asserted anything about the wallpaper's text — which is exactly how it
survived a concept change.** `tests/shell/shell-source.test.ts [u3#c9] (f)` now
holds it, with `(g)` as its teeth against the vendored design file. Scoped to
`index.html` on purpose: `data/scenario/우는다리/` is a complete, kept, lint-clean
pack full of that vocabulary and `e2e/fonts.spec.ts` uses 정착부 as a rendering
sample, so the claim is "the shell markup may not hard-code scenario vocabulary",
not a repo-wide word ban. Two stale comments naming the dropped concept went with
it, in `index.html` and in `signin.css` (which called the drawing "the bridge this
whole simulation is about" — false twice over).

**THE FIRST DEPLOY BLINKS, AND ONLY THE FIRST.** `.btn-deploy.is-cued` alternates
the control's deactivated `--graphite` and its activated `--seal-2` on a **0.5 s
whole cycle** — no `alternate`, which would have been a 1 s round trip wearing a
0.5 s number — with a hard cut over 0.1% so it reads as a signal lamp rather than a
throb. Background only: geometry on a timer would look like a button being pressed
by nobody, and the coach layer measures targets off `getBoundingClientRect`. It runs
only while the mounted page is the live page at index 1 (`pages()` is
`[cover, ...filed, live]`, so that is the first sitting and nothing after it), and
the press spends it permanently — before `openConfirm`, so answering 취소 does not
bring it back. Afterwards the control simply shows what it normally would; 민서's
ruling, and worth recording that "the activated colour (red)" is this button's
**hover** colour, not an enabled state — its resting background has always been
graphite. Three hazards were checked rather than hoped: `base.css` collapses every
animation to a 1 ms pass landing on the **100%** keyframe, so red is at 100% and a
reduced-motion operator gets a still red DEPLOY (verified: 0 infinite animations
running, background `rgb(141,26,32)`); `revealDesk` reads `getAnimations()` on window
roots without `{subtree:true}` and filters `Infinity` anyway, so the cue cannot hold
the boot curtain as x3's ring once did; and the walk's only `#btnDeploy` plate opens
after 21:04 of day 1, by which point the live page is index 2, the control wears
`next`, and the latch is spent.

**THE CUE'S CYCLE IS 1 s, NOT 0.5 — and there are two cues now.** 민서 read 0.5 s as
too fast on the built page, so `dzCue` is 1000 ms (500 graphite, 500 red; skewed,
the longer half would read as what the button *is* and the shorter as a flash, which
is a different signal). The old number is recorded rather than deleted — "too fast"
only means something against the number it was too fast for.

And a second mark answers the same kind of gap at the other end of the file: **after
the cover's reveal lands, one second of silence, then a transparent box with a red
border blinks around `›`** until the operator presses it. Same 1 s cycle, because a
desk that blinks at two rates is a desk with two alarms. It is a `::after` box, not
an `outline` and not a `box-shadow` — and the reason is stronger than "the focus ring
uses outline": an ANIMATED property outranks every author declaration for the whole
run, so a cue on any property of the button itself would not merely resemble focus,
it would *suppress* it. The pseudo-element owns nothing else, so border, background,
outline and transform all stay with the cascade. `PG_CUE_ARM_MS = 1000` is declared
apart from the sheet's cycle: same figure, different kind of number, neither derived
from the other.

Its arm is guarded by `viewing !== 0` **inside** the arm rather than by agreement
between callers, which matters because `landCover()` has three of them and the third
is `turn()` mounting a non-cover page — the operator who has already turned the page
must not be asked to. It also arms on the `motionless()` path, where there is no
reveal at all: that operator got no beat of motion to say the document had ended, and
under the same media query the blink degrades to a still mark rather than a flash.
Its latch is its own, and the direction that bites is the reverse of the obvious one —
the page turn is what MOUNTS the page the DEPLOY cue lives on, so a shared flag would
mean following the first hint took the second away.

Verified against the harness rather than assumed: `e2e/fixtures/harness.ts`'s
`DEFAULT_SEEK_MS = 2000` is an exact multiple of 1000, so frozen captures still land
on iteration start (0% — graphite, the button's own background) and the tracked shots
do not record a lit cue. 700/750/1500 would have broken that; the arithmetic is in
the sheet.

**THE RP / LF / AF TAGS ARE OFF THE WINDOWS.** `.win-tab` was a clipped trapezoid
23px above each title bar carrying a two-letter code — the initials of the name
printed directly below it, which is x5's argument against the `ko`/`sub` subtitles
over again. Element, rule and `WindowDef.tab` all gone; nothing else read the field
(the taskbar prints `def.en`). 민서 asked for the positions kept, and they are kept
**by construction**: the rule was `position:absolute;top:-23px`, and the proof it
reserved no space is that `layout.ts` uses `GAP = 16` between stacked windows, so 7px
of the tab was hanging *over* the window above it. A layout that had allowed for it
would have used ≥23. `--tab-hi` / `--tab-lo` are left in `tokens.css`, orphaned on
purpose: a declared palette entry makes no false claim about a surface the way an
orphaned rule does.

**The nine tracked reference shots are refreshed, clearing x5's debt with x10's.**
`shell-desktop-1280x800.png` and `red-thread-overlay.png` were showing the tags —
and had *also* been stale since x5, still displaying the deleted Korean window
subtitles and taskbar names. One
`CAPTURE_BASELINE=1 SHOT_OUT=e2e/reference-shots` pass clears both. `captures.spec.ts`
pairs names and sizes rather than pixels, so nothing had failed; that is precisely why
the drift accumulated. Re-verified afterwards in a NORMAL run (11 passed), and the
per-run `capture-note.md` the refresh drops into the output directory was removed
rather than committed — it describes a run, not a baseline.

**Also:** the cover types 20% faster (`COVER_MS_PER_CHAR` 45 → 36,
`COVER_MS_WORD` 130 → 104 — x7 raised these from 22/45 yesterday and overshot; the
340 ms line pause was ruled correct and is untouched), which takes the whole reveal
from 22.5 s to **18.7 s**, and the doc comment claiming "roughly a quarter-minute"
now states the real figure instead of the pre-x7 one. `ECHO` on the cover is set in
`--mono` — it is a callsign issued by 본부, and the two other surfaces that print it
as a value were already mono, so this rule was the one place the same string wore
the serif.

**NO ALERT PLATE IS SET IN 명조 ANY MORE, and the scope was reversed twice in a
day.** x10 first put only the briefing's lead into `--mono` so it would match the
prose under it, keeping the serif on the confirmation's question and the endings'
verdicts on the reading that those are somebody SPEAKING. 민서 overruled the scope:
명조 leaves the plates entirely. So the face is one declaration on the shared
`.cf-ask` in `confirm.css`, inherited by all three families, and the briefing's own
override is **deleted** rather than left equal to the template — a redundant override
claims the plate needs its own face and goes stale in silence. What the desk now says
is that every plate is the TERMINAL issuing something; the people speak in the two
REPORTS bodies and in the feed, and those keep the serif. The lost reading is kept in
`win-ending.css` on the record, because an ending is the closest thing on this desk to
someone addressing the operator and giving that up is a real cost.

The guard moved with it and is **stronger** for the re-aim (C17, logged): it used to
pin the SCOPE — `.man-plate` mono, confirm myeong — so a re-scope had to find and edit
three per-family assertions and could leave one behind. It now pins the RULE: declared
exactly once, and no alert sheet may name `--myeong` anywhere. Verified red both ways.
Comments are stripped before that scan, because all three sheets discuss the face at
length and a guard reading prose would fire on the reasoning.

**MINING IS HELD WHILE THE PREVIOUS AGENT'S 인수인계 사항 TYPES ITSELF OUT**, and the
gate has no state of its own. The signal is `SlotBoard.isRevealing()` — literally
`reveal !== null` — read through the `getSlotBoard()` singleton that `windows/reports.ts`
already consults for `isLocked()` inside `onMine`. A `<body>` class was rejected on the
grounds that every precedent for one (`booting`, `signin`, `man-step`) is a *shell*
module, and a component writing one would be a second copy of a fact the board owns —
a class nobody removes is a desk where mining never comes back. **Because there is no
gate variable there is nothing to leak:** `reveal` has one clearer and three exits
reach it (last character, watchdog, a replaced reveal), and the early-return paths —
empty file, reduced motion, the determinism gate — leave `reveal === null` by
construction, so they never gate at all. `aria-disabled` is re-derived from
`marks + held` in one repaint pass rather than undone, so releasing restores each
sentence's own state.

**And that reveal now types at 54% of its old duration** — `msPerChar` 11 → **6**,
`msBetween` 130 → **70**, holding the pause at ~11.7 characters' worth. The pace is a
PARAMETER, not a fork: `typewriter.ts` bundles the old numbers as `READING_PACE` and
defaults to them, so `components/report-view.ts` — the other caller — is byte-for-byte
untouched and the reports still read at the desk's reading pace. Measured on the
woodari fixtures (42 sentences, median 34 chars): four median sentences 2016 → 1096 ms,
a real run-03 pick 2104 → 1124 ms. Both totals are pinned to the arithmetic by a guard
that recomputes them off the fixture, so the note cannot go stale the way the cover's
"quarter-minute" did. The watchdog is unaffected — it counts frames since the last
tick, not expected duration.

**THE COVER OPENS ON A DIFFERENT INCIDENT** (민서, 08-10): 18시 38분 ·
한내시립스포츠돔에서 천장 가운데가 처진다는 신고. The third line is untouched — who
본부 dispatched is a fact about the agent programme, not about the building. **These two
lines are the PACK's and nothing checks the agreement**, which is the standing hazard
now written at the constant: the time has to match `meta.json`'s `start` (the clock's
own opening) and the place has to match `places.json`, the symptoms, the timeline and
every line the feed prints. They were changed ahead of the sports-dome pack landing, so
if the desk clock does not open on 18:38 it is probably this file that is wrong. The
endings still name 해원터널 (and 갱구, and 341명) — deliberately out of scope, handled by
the deploy that is landing the pack. **[Closed — that deploy is #230, one entry down. It
merged before this one, so by the time you read this the endings name the dome. The
agreement this paragraph asks for holds: `meta.json`'s `start` is 18:38.]**

**THE ROOM IS ALREADY THERE WHEN THE OPERATOR SIGNS IN.** `openTheRoom()` moved off
`deskReady` and onto the audio `unlock()`, reversing its own recorded ruling that "the
opening belongs to the desk". **On load there is still silence and nothing fetched** —
a browser suspends any `AudioContext` built outside a gesture, so "from the first
painted frame" is not something any layer can be asked for. The first keystroke of the
15-press card is the gesture, which `sfxKeyTick` already proved works at the door; the
bed fades in under the card being typed and the sparse office follows. Hanging it off
the unlock is also what makes both door paths work through ONE code path — the unlock
is the only moment the door and `?signin=skip` share, so the `boot.ts` call site did
not have to move.

**The Watch drone stays gated on the desk, and splitting it was the point.** Ten
seconds beginning at the login screen are gone before the card is typed, so the map's
`playForMs` window would have silenced the drone instead of shaping it — and
`advance(0)` can release the first `beat_start` while the door is still up, raising a
drone under the sign-in plate, which plan-audio §4.4 forbids. `playForMs` is now
documented as measured from each bed's OWN opening, which is two different moments.

**Ambience bus 0.15 → 0.10 → 0.05, in two passes** (−9.5 dB in total), bus only, no cue
gain moved — the bed↔office gap §4.4 calls "the whole effect" is bus-invariant.
`plan-audio.md`'s figures are kept in step (bed **−39.5 LUFS**). 0.10 was still not
quiet enough on the running desk; 0.05 is where 민서 set it.

**AND THE OFFICE ONE-SHOTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE INAUDIBLE, BY INSTRUCTION.** §4.4's
tuning history rejected −20.9 dB for the sparse phone/printer/keys as "still reading
like an empty office", and 0.05 × the office cue's 0.8 puts them at **−28.0 dB — 7 dB
past that line.** At the 0.10 pass the standing advice was to answer exactly this with
`office.gain` 0.8 → 1.0 and never with the bus; 민서 was asked and ruled the other way
("the office.gain is fine"), then took the bus down a second time. So the room is now a
bed with events in it that may or may not be caught, rather than a room asserting
itself. That is recorded in `$buses`, in §4.4 and at the assertion holding
`office.gain` at 0.8, all three saying the same thing: **do not raise it to "restore"
the one-shots without asking** — the two rejected settings were rejected against a
different brief. `npm run audio:table` could not be re-run — no `ffprobe` on
this machine — so one generated line was hand-edited to what the generator emits;
regenerate on a machine with ffmpeg. Pre-existing and left alone: that generated block
still claims "Ambience retires 10000 ms after the desk opens", false since
`deskHolds: true` landed on 08-09, because `tools/audio/build-audio-pack.mjs` does not
read `deskHolds`.

**RUN LOCAL E2E AS `CI=1`.** One run in this session reported 32 failures that read
exactly like a regression and were not: `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` had
silently adopted a concurrent run's server from the sibling `scenario-model` worktree,
so the suite spent 6.6 minutes asserting against another branch's bundle. The ports
are hard-coded and shared by every worktree, and the failing direction is not the
dangerous one — the same mechanism will report GREEN whenever the foreign build
happens to satisfy the assertions, with the tree under test never compiled. Full
finding, and the one-command diagnostic, in `DISCOVERY.md`.

Verified on the merged tree: `npm run check` clean · **1759** unit tests (111 files)
· **224** e2e chromium (4.8 m, `CI=1`) · **7** e2e preview against the real `dist/` ·
**11** captures re-paired against the refreshed baseline. Screenshot-checked on the
production build at each step; the nine tracked shots were refreshed twice, once for
the tab removal and again once the plate type and the cover's incident changed the
pixels under them.
Screenshot-checked at nine states on the production build, not the dev server: both
plates measure head 42 / body 195 / foot 37 / button 24, the confirmation plate the
same, the wallpaper carries 0 `<text>` nodes, `ECHO` resolves to IBM Plex Mono
inside a Nanum Myeongjo sentence, the cue's two halves are `rgb(36,42,48)` and
`rgb(141,26,32)`, and `is-cued` is false after 취소.

**One flake worth adding to the `desk` list, not caused by x10.**
`tests/assets/no-third-party-url.test.ts` runs a full `vite build` inside a vitest
`beforeAll` (240 s timeout). It failed to collect on one of four local runs, taking
its 9 tests with it while the other 1720 passed; the other three runs were clean and
the file is untouched by x10. That is structurally the same family as the four
wall-clock-coupled e2e assertions that took the `desk` required check offline on
08-09 — a unit suite is supposed to be the fast deterministic gate, and this one has
a production build in it.

## Status (2026-08-10) — the desk plays a different disaster, and the agent it plays against was re-measured

PR #230, merged before x10 above. The scenario-drafting skill and the generation
guide had stopped tracking the concept several changes ago, so the model was rebuilt
from scratch without consulting either, a writing brief was derived from it, and one
pack was authored through that brief and shipped. **`PACK_SLUG` is now 멈춘회전문.**

**THE ORDER OF AUTHORING INVERTED.** Endings → routes → gates → the knowledge each
gate needs → and the timeline written last, carrying only rows that deliver that
knowledge. Four things follow. A failure is not where the run stops but where the
agent's hands stop reaching — the clock keeps running, reports keep arriving, and
that tail is the next attempt's briefing, which is the only place keys come from. The
first attempt passes exactly one gate and then fails, because the knowledge the
remaining edges demand does not exist until the disaster is over, which makes the
no-intervention default a matter of structure rather than probability. The tally is
decided by the last node reached. And temperament conditional clauses are **gone** —
the lock existed to manufacture failure in a scenario that had none of its own, and
the graph does that job now. The decisions record is `planning/scenario-model.md`;
the brief is `planning/scenario-writer-brief.md`.

**멈춘회전문.** An air-supported dome under heavy snow: the roof sags, and the people
inside leave through a revolving door that turns two at a time. The way out and the
force holding the roof up are the same variable, so opening a door is the same act as
bringing the roof down. Three gates, two winning routes, three characters, seventeen
timeline rows, 18:38–21:35, nineteen beats. The ladder, verified against the engine's
own scorer — monotone, and the floor is the record, not an invention:

    F1  no intervention   207   185 · 21 · 문세라 dies
    F2  +headcount         57    44 · 12 · 문세라 dies
    F3  +west sleeve       12     9 ·  3 · 문세라 lives
    WIN_A +vent restored    0     표기웅 charged, the sign-off investigated
    WIN_B +north door       0     표기웅 charged, 문세라 fractures an ankle

**TWO GATES ARE MEASURED AND ONE IS NOT, AND THE FAILURE IS ON THE RECORD.** 36 arms,
360 calls through `tools/probe`, every one pre-registered with an arm diff and a
placebo. G1: baseline 10/10 on the default, key 10/10 to the non-default, placebo
10/10 back on the default. G2: baseline 10/10, key moved 7/10, placebo 9/10. Both
pass their pre-registered drop conditions. **G3 was repaired six times and failed six
times** — three label rewrites, one addition to world physics, one cost-symmetry
rewrite, one temperament change — and the baseline never moved. The diagnosis is the
position, not the wording: at 19:58 opening the emergency door is the correct act, and
no key gates a correct act. It routes cleanly to `WIN_B`; what the player hands over
just does not decide it. Records in `tools/probe/dday-mechanism/runs/DOME-*`, failures
included, and the brief's §5 carries the rules the probes bought.

**THE AGENT WE MEASURED WAS NOT THE AGENT WE DEPLOYED, in two places.** This is the
part worth carrying forward: gate numbers describe a *prompt*, and they describe the
*game* only if the game sends that prompt. (1) The three DOME suites carried their own
`FLAW` · `INCIDENT` · `PRIORITY_LIST`; the proxy shipped four different values
globally. `default-prompt.ts` had predicted this in its own header — "if a second
scenario wants a different flaw, this becomes a lookup keyed by pack, and the payload
has to name the pack" — so `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` is now keyed by slug and `CallRequest`
carries `pack`. The slug travels as a NAME, never as values: the client may ask for an
agent and still cannot author one, so the refusal in call contracts §6 is untouched.
An unknown slug falls back to the incumbent rather than 400ing, because the two tiers
deploy on separate triggers and a client can outrun its proxy — rejecting would turn
that window into "every Call 1 fails and every gate takes its default stance". (2) The
probe fixture ADDRESSES the agent (너는 회선 저쪽이…) and the pack DESCRIBED it
(요원은…), with `renderTemperament` passing that straight through. The pack now carries
the fixture's wording and the renderer no longer inserts a blank line under its header,
which none of the three fixtures have either. **What stops both from rotting is
`tests/shared/default-prompt-coverage.test.ts`**: it fails when `PACK_SLUG` has no
entry, and it reads the suite JSON to check each entry still matches the suite that
measured it, slot for slot. A literal copied into the test would have drifted in
exactly the silence it exists to break. Wire shape amended in `contract-calls.md`
§10/§11.

**THE ENDING WAS NOT A ONE-LINE SWITCH, and one constant decided whether the game
works.** `RESCUE_TOTAL` was 1 — 전구간정상's rescue left 오세라 inside the ninth door.
Both of this pack's winning routes close on **0** and no run closes on 1, so leaving it
alone would have made the good ending unreachable: the player wins and sees nothing.
`TUNNEL_OCCUPANTS` 341 → `SITE_OCCUPANTS` 736. One FACT changed with it: 오세라 walked
into the tunnel and was never one of its 341, so her death was held out of the crowd
arithmetic and the plate's two numbers deliberately did not sum; 문세라 is inside the
dome from the first minute, so here they do. The hold-out mechanism is kept rather than
inlined — a future pack whose named person stands outside the crowd needs it back
without a rewrite — and the test says plainly that on this pack that branch is untested
by construction. **One guard was lost and is recorded as lost:** the old test asserted
"total 0 is NOT the good ending", which also stood watch over a short or unscored
ledger reading as a perfect day. Here 0 IS the win, so the two are no longer
distinguishable at that seam; the real defence was always upstream (`scoreRecord`
returns null, not 0, when no unit resolved) and the inverted test now says so. Copy
re-authored for the dome by 민서, three beats and the shared sentence kept.

**AUTHORING TOOLS RELAXED, AND A FROZEN PATH RELEASED.** The graph-first method uses
neither temperament clauses nor key conditions, and the schemas made all three
mandatory — so `key_conditions` and `key_examples` left `required` and `clauses.minItems`
went 1 → 0. Every edit is a WIDENING: nothing changed type, nothing changed shape, and
전구간정상 and 우는다리 still lint at ERROR 0. That put the work under
`data/scenario/_schema/`, which the two frozen-input guards hold, so both now release
it — and the release note separates the two claims that kept it frozen. The freeze's own
premise died at #110 with the rest. What kept it frozen past that was the second claim,
that §3.6's grammar was sized so hardening would never need the schemas, and that held
only for packs authored the way 우는다리 was.

**THE LINT FLAG LIST IS NOT A WORKLIST.** Six FLAGs: three `edge_predicates empty`,
which is dead wiring (compiled, returned as `nextNode` from `submitStance`, consumed by
nothing in `src`), and three second-meter-unbound, which is the idiom in every pack
here. For scale: 멈춘회전문 6, 전구간정상 9, 우는다리 26. This pack is cleaner than what
already shipped.

**IT DEPLOYED, AND THAT WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.** All three workflows green on
the merge commit — CI, Pages, and Proxy deploy, the last of which health-checks the
stack and then makes a real model call asserting `x-llm-fallback: false`. Live: the page
title reads 멈춘 회전문, `data/scenario/멈춘회전문/meta.json` serves off the deployed
base, and `/dday/health` answers `{"ok":true,…"calls":true}` on haiku-4-5. `desk` went
3-for-3 green across the PR at ~13 min a run, which is NOT evidence its four flaky
assertions were fixed — they were never touched — and it is still not a required
context on ruleset 19214918.

**WHAT IS NOT SETTLED.** The probes went over the Anthropic API and the game calls
Bedrock through the proxy: same model, different serving path and tool-call envelope,
so the post-deploy call proves the tier answers and does not re-measure the gates.
10/10 is not p = 1 — ten samples per arm on a pinned model bound a drop condition and
nothing more. `proxy/events/call.json` still carries no `pack`, so the post-deploy smoke
exercises the fallback rather than the lookup. And nobody has sat four attempts through;
the suite plays the pack in a real browser, which is not the same thing. One stale
sentence above, in x10's wallpaper paragraph: "the shipped pack is a tunnel" was true
when written and is not now.

## Status (2026-08-09) — the desk gets a room, and it costs 27.6 kB

**The bed is an office now, and it holds.** A real recording of an empty office
(CC0, Freesound) loops under the desk for the whole session, with one distant
one-shot — keys, a phone, a printer — sown beneath it every 5–10 s. plan-audio
§2's "no melodic BGM" survives untouched and is now stated properly: the bar was
never *quiet*, it is **made of objects**, which a drone fails and a fan passes.

Two new fields carry it, both pure data. `ambience.deskHolds` splits the two
beds, which want opposite things — the Watch drone still retires at 10 s because
pressure has to let up, and the room does not, because a room that switches
itself off after ten seconds was never one. `ambience.sparse` is a timer that
re-rolls its interval after every play, and it is deliberately **outside
`TRIGGERS`**: that set is the closed vocabulary of moments the *game* can sound,
and nothing in the game happens when a phone rings two desks away.

**Measured, not guessed.** Bed asset at -13.5 LUFS → **-30.0 LUFS** out through
`gain: 1` × the 0.15 ambience bus; the one-shots sit ~10 dB under it, and that
gap is the whole effect. Every office cue is cut `highpass=150,lowpass=3500` —
distance, not tone-shaping: a crisp keystroke at this level is
indistinguishable from the report window typing, which is a cue that carries
meaning (§2 rule 3).

**+27.6 kB, all of it in the second load wave, and still 0 bytes before the
first gesture.** The bed itself was free: `amb-office-tone` replaced the
synthesised `amb-room-tone` at almost exactly its size. Shipping both would have
put the ambience wave 100 kB over its §6 budget for a file nothing referenced,
so the synth room tone is retired — `synth.mjs` keeps the generator and
restoring it is one line in `CUES` plus a rebuild.

`tests/shell/audio-office.test.ts` guards the seam, because this is the 08-08
lesson's exact shape: the office is armed once at `openTheRoom`, from data only
the live boot reads, and then does nothing for ten seconds — a browser suite
would watch it do nothing and pass. A map that fails validation leaves the desk
**silent** rather than broken, so a typo in `audio-map.json` deletes the whole
audio layer without breaking a pixel. That is what the suite is for. Write-up:
[plan-audio.md](./plan-audio.md) §4.4.
## Status (2026-08-09) — the door is typed in, and the membrane is the mechanic

**The opening screen had one thing on it and that thing was already done.** Both
fields arrived pre-filled, `저장됨` sat to the right of the mask saying the
password was remembered, and LOGIN was live on the first frame with its highlight
sweeping across it every 3.6 s. A judge's first interaction with the game was a
formality — press the one hot button on a finished form. (민서, 08-09.)

**Now the operator types the card in.** The wells start empty; every press lands
one character, `OP-2291` and then eight mask glyphs; LOGIN is `disabled` until the
fifteenth. `저장됨` is gone with the claim it made — a field being entered by hand
cannot also be a field that was saved.

**WHAT was pressed never reaches WHAT appears, and that is the point rather than a
concession.** `doorFill(strokes: number)` is the whole state machine and its
signature is the guard: there is no parameter through which a pressed character
could travel, so mashing the keyboard still types the terminal's own badge number.
The membrane (spec-client §3 inv 1) is not merely *survived* at the door, it is
what the door is *about* — the player's hands are on this desk and their words are
not in it — which is why this screen can ask for fifteen keystrokes without
becoming a text field. The readout two beats later shows the pair resolving:
`사용자 조회 — OP-2291 tester_123 … 확인`.

**Three things the brief did not ask for and the screen could not ship without:**

- **A tap counts as a press.** There is no focused field here to summon a soft
  keyboard, so on a touch screen `keydown` never fires — a key-only door is a dead
  end for every phone that opens the deployed site. `pointerdown` on the layer is
  the same gesture by another instrument, and on a desktop it pays again: the
  player who reaches for the dead button is taught the mechanic by the character
  that appears when they press it.
- **An IME counts too.** Chrome hands `key: 'Process'` for a 두벌식 keystroke on
  some platforms — one press, no character. A plain "single-character key" rule
  gives a Korean operator a door that ignores them, on a Korean-language game.
- **The locked slab had to LOOK locked.** `pointer-events:none` was the whole of
  the old disabled state. `filter:grayscale(.95) brightness(.58)` drains the same
  button rather than painting a second one, so the armed state needs no
  declarations at all — dropping the attribute restores every value already there.

**The one orchestrated beat.** `siArm` fires on the fifteenth press: grey slab →
over-bright → the seal's resting red, 550 ms, with focus landing on it. Focus is
also the only announcement this door makes and the only one it owes. The animation
carries **no fill mode** deliberately — filled, it would pin `filter:none` and
`transform:none` for the rest of the door's life and `:hover`/`:active`, which are
nothing but a filter and a transform, would never be seen again.

**Light blue is where the terminal is listening.** `.si-field.is-armed` is one
class on one row and it moves the label, the well's ring and the caret together.
The lit colour is `--gauge-2` — the caret's own, and the gauges' — not the seal's
red: red on this desk means 관인, and a field waiting for a keystroke is an
instrument that is on, not an alarm. Same argument `coach.css` records for why the
onboarding mark stopped pulsing.

**A reduced-motion claim was written, tested, found false, and replaced with the
truth.** The caret is load-bearing for the first time, `base.css` collapses every
animation to a 1 ms pass, and `siBlink` ends on `opacity:0` — so the sheet gained
a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` restatement. The e2e test for it passed with
the block **deleted**: `siBlink` is *unfilled*, so opacity falls back to the `.85`
on `.si-caret` itself and the caret settles STILL rather than dark. That is the
opposite of `litPulse`, which was `animation … both`. The block is gone; a comment
records why there is none, and two guards now pin the absence it rests on (the
blink is unfilled; shown/hidden is `display`, never the opacity the blink uses).

**Verified:** `npm run check` clean · **1692** unit tests (109 files) · the
chromium e2e lane green · **18** new unit tests (`tests/shell/sign-in.test.ts`,
node-env: the arithmetic, the key rule, the two removals) · **16** new browser
tests (`e2e/signin.spec.ts`, the only spec that sees the door — `signInSkipped`
keys off `navigator.webdriver`, so `?signin=show` is the override). Screenshot-
verified against the **production** build on `vite preview`, at all five states.

**Two guards were verified red-then-green by breaking the thing they measure** —
the greyed slab, and the tap path. A third caught a real defect while being
written: `doorFill(NaN)` returned `armed: null` with two empty lines, because
`Math.min`/`Math.max` propagate NaN instead of clamping it — a door with no caret,
no character and no way forward. Unreachable from inside the module, reachable
through an exported contract that says `number`; `Number.isFinite` is the floor.

## Status (2026-08-09) — the onboarding walk speaks

**The tutorial was a silent red ring and now it is eight plates that say one line
each.** `x3` shipped the walk as twelve pulses of `.is-lit` with no copy anywhere
on the screen, on the argument that a coach mark is a product-tour bubble and an
overlay must not sit on the controls it points at. The argument was sound and it
lost to the requirement: a window glowing red reads as *something is wrong*, not
*read this*, and the desk has roughly sixty seconds to carry a judge.
`shell/coach.ts` + `styles/coach.css` are the plate, a red leader line and a scrim
holed over the target; `styles/tutorial.css` is deleted. The walk is driven
entirely by what the operator does — every stopwatch is gone, including the
eight-second hold on the file and the ten-second ceiling on 해제 — and every plate
carries a way out of the whole walk. The gating is unchanged:
`?tutorial=show` / `?tutorial=skip`, off under `navigator.webdriver`, so every e2e
lane but `e2e/tutorial.spec.ts` still sees no walk at all.

**THE PLATE IS ONE ROW OF CHROME** (x8, 민서 08-09). It was a paper slip with an
`안내` header band and two worded buttons under a rule — three rows to say one
line, and none of the furniture carried the lesson. What is left is a single dark
bar sized to its own sentence: `--mono` at 12.6px in `--txt-hi` on the desk's own
`--chrome-*` gradient, then `▶▶` outlined to leave the walk, then a red 23×20
square with a `✓` to take the step. `white-space:nowrap` + `width:max-content`, so
a long step is a long bar and never a second line (measured: 249px shortest, 412px
longest, 34px tall in both). The two words survive only as `aria-label`s. `▶▶`
rather than the requested `⏩` because U+23E9 is emoji-presentation and ignores
`color` — a colour glyph cannot be the white/grey mark the design asks for.

**THE BUILD PHASE IS UNNARRATED** (x8). Three plates opened this walk and all
three are cut: the file's head line, the page control, and the commit. Every one
pointed into the AGENT FILE before the day had started, and the AGENT FILE is the
one window that now introduces *itself* — x7's cover types its incident brief out
on arrival, the handover rows materialise one at a time, and the press names the
agent and then stamps the chop as two beats. A plate narrating a document in the
middle of performing its own opening is a second voice over the first.

Stated rather than discovered: the operator is no longer told to turn the page or
to press DEPLOY, and the walk cannot say a word until they have worked out both —
`simStarted` is chained off the press. The walk is strictly the debrief now. Note
this branch is still based on pre-x7 `main`, where the cover does *not* type
itself out, so the silence is more total here than it will be after the re-aim.

**The layer is non-blocking by construction, and that is load-bearing rather
than polite.** The scrim and the leader are one `pointer-events:none` SVG whose
hole is cut with `fill-rule:evenodd`, so the target reads at full brightness and
*every pixel of the desk stays pressable, dimmed or not*. Most plates come down
when the operator presses the very thing the mark names, so a layer that ate that
press would deadlock its own walk. `e2e/tutorial.spec.ts (f)`/`(g)` prove the
press lands in a browser; the source guard proves the declaration it rests on.

**NOTHING INTERRUPTS THE DAY** (민서, 08-09). While the simulation is running the
operator is reading the LIVE FEED, and the walk does not talk over it. Plates 2
through 5 hang off a single gate — the day being over with both documents filed —
and the run of them is a debrief: the REPORTS window, its two columns, and the
gesture that moves a sentence out of them.

The plate that broke this was the REPORTS one. The flow as first written asked for
it "when the first REPORTS start coming in", and on this desk that lands mid-shift
— a live day files seven reports across the day — so the walk raised a plate and
dimmed the desk in the middle of the one stretch of the game the player is meant
to be watching, one plate after having told them to watch it. `report` is no
longer subscribed to at all; the record's own DOM is what says the day produced
something, which is also the only thing those four plates need to be true.

`e2e/tutorial.spec.ts (m)` is the guard, and it earns its 82 seconds: it arms a
MutationObserver inside the page, sits through a **full real-time shift**, and
asserts no plate was mounted at any point while the run phase was live. Sampling
for a mid-day instant was tried first and is a race — the fixture files its one
report a few seconds before 21:04, so a polling loop steps straight over the
window it is trying to measure. Watching cannot miss it, and it proves the
stronger claim.

**Three defects were found and fixed at the source rather than worked around.**

- **`.pg-turn:not([disabled])` was never a name for 다음 장.** It isolates the
  forward leaf on the *cover* alone, because that is the one page where 이전 장 is
  the disabled one; on the agent's page it points at 이전 장, and once a past page
  exists (U5.3 files one per closed day) **both** leaves are enabled and it
  resolves to two elements. `windows/agent-file.ts` classes them `pg-prev` /
  `pg-next`. `pg-turn` stays on both, so all 25 existing e2e call sites and both
  CSS rules are untouched.
- **인수인계 사항 was addressed by a STATE, not a name.** `.sect.operable` is
  what the same section stops being when a past page renders it `filed`.
  `components/dossier.ts` slugs its sections and the plate points at
  `[data-sect="handover"]`. 기질 deliberately carries no slug — `[u4#c2]` pins the
  sealed section's key set to exactly four fields. *(Superseded at the merge: 기질
  no longer exists. See the re-aim note at the foot of this entry.)*
- **The mine gate latched on the wrong event.** Mining is *refused* while the day
  runs (`windows/reports.ts` bails on `board.isLocked()`), so a mid-day click on
  a sentence seats nothing — and would have raised the 인수인계 plate over an
  empty section. A keyboard mine raises no click at all, since a sentence is a
  `role="button"` span. The gate reads the mine's *outcome*, `#w-file .slot.filled`.

**A toast collision was reported here and it is WITHDRAWN.** The branch was cut at
#218 and the walk was reviewed against that base, where `#toast` was still a
painted panel centred at 50%/50% — which is where the file-title plate landed
(x8 has since cut it), so the opening announcement covered what was then the first
instruction the player ever read. `#coach` was
raised to 955 to get out from under it. That whole fix was unnecessary: x6b (#221)
had already taken the toast's visible panel away and left a 1×1 live region, so on
`main` the collision cannot happen. `main` is merged in (#221 · #222 · #223), the
z-index is back at **690**, and the ladder claim is asserted rather than commented
— `tests/shell/tutorial-observer.test.ts` reads `#topbar` / `#threads` / `#manual`
/ `#signin` / `#grain` / `#confirm` / `#ending` out of their own sheets, and pins
`#toast` as still being the 1×1 region, so a re-painted toast lands here as a
failure instead of as an announcement across a plate. The grain falling across the
plate is deliberate at 690: the mark is furniture on this desk, and a plate the
film does not touch would read as pasted on from outside the fiction.

**Merging `main` also brought the ending sequence** (`shell/ending.ts`, `#ending`
at z-index 990) under the walk, and the conflicts in `dossier.ts` (x6 rewrote
`coverModel` to take no argument) and `index.css` (the new `win-ending.css`
import) are resolved keeping both sides: main's copy and structure, the branch's
section slugs.

**Verified:** `npm run check` green · **1677** unit tests · **205** e2e (chromium
lane — x6b retired two waiting-marker specs, this branch adds one) · 7
preview-smoke on the real production artefact, load budget included ·
`e2e/tutorial.spec.ts` **13** tests · the plates walked and screenshotted on both
the fixture host and `npm run preview`, plus 1280×800 and
`prefers-reduced-motion`. `is-lit` appears nowhere in the bundle. The re-aim is
logged in `DISCOVERY.md` per `[u11#c6] (l)`.

**What the three cut plates cost the suite, and how it was paid.** Four tests were
pinned to them. `(e)` is now an assertion of ABSENCE — it walks the whole build
phase and proves no plate follows the page turn, none follows the DEPLOY press,
and none lands on the 배치 확인 modal, which is the only kind of test that proves a
cut landed. `(f)`, the "scrim does not swallow the press it points at" test, was
proved on the page-turn plate and is re-aimed onto the MINE, the earliest
surviving plate that still ends on a press; `(g)` does the same for 해제. `(d)`
keeps its regression (the old infinite pulse stalling `revealDesk`) but asserts
the property that is left: the curtain comes up on its own and the desk is
operable with no plate to guide it.

**Not done, deliberately:** the walk puts no plate on the 배치 확인 modal and does
not re-show plate 3 if the operator answers 취소 (민서's call). Nothing stalls —
plate 4 is armed on the simulation starting, so it appears whenever they do
commit; they simply lose that one hint.

**RE-AIMED ONTO CURRENT MAIN at the merge (08-09), and one claim above is now
false.** This work was built on `59d87d6`; `main` moved 30 files past it, two of
them the walk reaches into — `windows/agent-file.ts` (+697) and
`components/dossier.ts` (+365). `pg-next` and `data-sect` are both this branch's,
neither exists on `main`, and both re-applied onto the rewritten files without
conflict. Every anchor still resolves and all 13 tutorial tests pass against the
merged tree unchanged.

The one conflict that needed a decision was the COVER. This branch slugged its
three sections (`mission`, `conduct`, `comms`) for three plates x8 then cut, and
`main` had meanwhile renamed all three and deleted 기질, `SEALED_*` and `CONDUCT`
outright. `main`'s sections win and the slugs are dropped: a slug is earned by
being pointed at from outside, and a slug with no caller reads as a contract when
it is a leftover. `handover` is the only one still earning its keep, which is also
the only one the walk ever used. The 기질 line in the selector notes above is kept
as written and marked superseded — the sealed section it reasons about is gone, so
the reasoning is history rather than a rule.

The verified numbers above are this branch's own and are not restated: the merged
tree is **1696** unit tests and **224** e2e chromium, both green, and those are the
figures in the door entry at the top of this file.

## Status (2026-08-08) — the loop the player operates, and two regressions only the live path could show

**The day now runs hands-off, and the operator's turn is at the close.** Four
units rebuilt the sitting (`plan-playtest.md` §1 U6): the resume carries a build
stamp so a stale tab is not a live sitting (`W1`); one sitting is one
accumulating record, keyed by RUN with rounds appended, which killed the
run/round keyspace collision in `railEntries` (`W2`); mining is one gesture —
a click mines *and* seats, and a refusal flashes instead of vanishing (`W3`);
and DEPLOY is one phase-gated press that commits the file and opens the next
day, which retired the ×1/×4/pause transport row with it (`W4`). A sitting's
rounds now break a line between them (`R1`). `main` is at #194.

**Two regressions shipped green through a 215-test browser suite, and the
reason is structural.** `e2e/` drives the DEV fixture loop, whose store is one
flat object surviving `new_run`; the live path rebuilds per day. Anything that
crosses a run boundary is therefore untested in the browser by construction.

- **The committed agent file never reached the model** (`H1`). `createMembrane`
  is per bound run, and `W4` re-armed the carried file in the live adapter's
  *view mirror* instead of the opened run's membrane. `unslot` answered
  `empty_slot`, so a carried sentence could not be released — the loop
  dead-ends once four seats arrive full — and `membrane.deployed()`, which is
  what `composer.judgment` carries into Call 1, was empty. **From day 2 onward
  on the live site, C-BLOCK was inert.** The fix replays the file as real
  `slot`/`deploy` ops, which the fixture loop's `carry()` always did.
- **A refresh returned a sitting that no longer existed** (`H2`). The resume
  restored callsign, counter and archive, and could not restore the filed
  report documents — they live in `windows/reports.ts` and are persisted
  nowhere — so F5 came back as ECHO-n with n empty rail tabs. A page load now
  starts a new sitting; `spec-client` §7 #8 is amended with it, and the audio
  mute key is deliberately not cleared.

**The rule this pays for:** a unit that changes what crosses a run boundary is
proved at the driver seam under vitest, never in the browser, and its Done-when
says so. The live path still has no end-to-end coverage at all — a real gap,
deliberately not closed before the deadline.

**Still open** — `plan-playtest.md` §3 carries the order, and it no longer
carries a cut line: everything listed there is meant to be built, and the two
items that are not (U2, O2) say so in place.

- **T3** — the desk is still three side-by-side columns, which is T1's shape,
  not T3's. T3 is two columns: REPORTS large on the left, the right split into
  LIVE FEED above and AGENT FILE below. REPORTS is where mining happens and
  where cause will render, and it currently has the middle of three narrow
  columns while the LIVE FEED ticker has the widest.
- **C1 → U5.3** — a page per ECHO-n, so the player can compare the file they
  gave one agent against the next. Today the previous sitting's file leaves the
  desk entirely when it is rebuilt, so nothing answers "what did I change, and
  what changed in the result". 민서 raised this ahead of U5.2c on 08-08: a
  citation is read once, a comparison is read every sitting after.
- **U5.2c** — render the cause. The seam already carries `cited_ids`.
- **The manual's §1–§4 content** — still placeholder, and two of its bodies are
  now false: they describe a 집계 window U3 deleted and a two-press day W4
  replaced.

## Status (2026-08-08) — the desk has sound, and it costs the opening paint nothing

**34 cues ship**, wired through one call in `boot.ts` step 4c. The whole layer is
an observer: it reads the §5.2 stream, the `[data-op]` census markers the five
membrane controls carry, the classes the window manager and the ledger set, the
fanfold's revealed lines and the report typewriter's own repaints. It sends no op
and no component imports it, so audio can be deleted or muted without touching
what is playable — which is also why `audio:check` is deliberately **not** in
`npm run check`. Plan, sources and per-criterion verification:
[plan-audio.md](./plan-audio.md); the mapping itself is law in
`data/policy/audio-map.json`.

**Nothing is fetched before the player's first gesture.** A browser suspends an
AudioContext built outside one, so the context, `audio-map.json` and every sample
wait for it — measured headless at **0 audio bytes at first paint**. The pack
then loads in three waves: the door's cues, the rest of the SFX, the two beds.
Unlocking happens at O1's door so its controls answer; the ambience waits for
`revealDesk` and retires 10 s later, because a room tone that plays out behind a
curtain is one nobody hears. The format is **AAC in MP4**: `decodeAudioData`
takes it in every desktop browser shipping today including Safari, and it does
not depend on an ffmpeg built with `libvorbis`.

**Everything sourced is CC0 or public domain**, so the game carries no mandatory
attribution. `assets-manifest.json`'s 34 audio rows are **generated** from the
builder's own source table (`npm run audio:manifest`), so provenance cannot drift
from what was built. The other half is synthesised by `tools/audio/synth.mjs` —
seeded and byte-reproducible, because the outputs are committed.

**Sizes:** 141.0 kB of SFX, 494.4 kB of ambience, ~7 kB of map.

**O3 coexists with this layer, moment by moment** (plan-audio §4.5). O3's
implementation (`shell/radio-sfx.ts`, merged in #179) keeps its three moments
and its no-assets approach — the carrier static under the LOGIN readout, the
squelch at the hand-over, and 21:04, where **the static swells and cuts, and
the silence after the cut is the cue**. This layer yields those three by data
(`door:login`, `boot` and `ending:collapse` bound `null`; the window observer
skips `.win-manual`) and does everything else, keeping the 2800 ms ledger lead
that guards the ending's silence. O3 reads this layer's `dday.audio.muted` key
before every burst, so the ♪ toggle is the desk's one mute. The yielded cues
ship in the pack; each rebind is a one-line map edit.

## Status (2026-08-06) — the deployed build was publishing its own answer key

**`dist/` is a player surface, and nothing was treating it as one.**
`copyPackData()` copied `data/scenario` and `data/policy` into `dist/`
recursively, so every authoring file sitting beside the parts the run fetches
shipped with them — `draft.md` above all, 44 kB carrying all eight gates with
their stances and outcomes, the key conditions, truths 1–5 and the
no-intervention line, readable at a URL on the live site. `vite.config.ts`'s own
rule said "By name, never `data/` wholesale"; it was honoured at directory
granularity and not at file granularity, and a recursive copy cannot express
"the pack, but not the source it was compiled from". It enumerates now: 22
published files → 8. `gates.json` has to ship, so its `standard_form` and
`branch_note` — which write a gate's answer out in prose — are stripped from the
published copy while the authored file keeps them.

**The same class of defect twice more, both caught by the guard the first one
motivated.** `tests/scaffold/published-data.test.ts` holds the allowlist to both
loaders' `PACK_FILES` and checks that no seam reads a stripped field. When
`main`'s score work merged into the playtest branch it added `score` to those
loaders — the scorer resolves `units[].predicates` at 21:04 — and the branch's
allowlist did not carry it, so the deployed client would have fetched a file the
build never copied. Publishing it raw would have re-opened the leak: its
`baseline_summary` states the no-intervention ending outright and
`attributed_gates` names the gates a unit hangs off. It ships stripped, on the
`gates.json` precedent; the scorer reads `id`, `label` and `predicates` and
derives the baseline by resolving the same predicates against the untouched day
rather than trusting the authored prose.

**`npm run check` runs no vitest**, which is why none of this was visible to the
gate most work runs. It is `tsc` (core + client) · `typecheck:test` ·
`datapack:check` · `test:shared`; every vitest suite, including every structural
guard, runs only under `npm run test`, and only `npm run build` shows what
actually ships. Any work that changes what reaches the browser has to run all
three.

**Also fixed:** `.min.slotted` — a highlight authored in u1 — had never rendered.
`sentenceState()` read `mined` before `slotted` and nothing can be slotted
without being mined, so the state was unreachable; and slotting repainted
nothing, because REPORTS subscribed to `meta`/`report` only while `slot` is a
membrane op. The suite covering it seated a slotted-but-unmined id, which the
engine forbids — it was covering a branch that could not execute.

**Playtest triage lives at [plan-playtest.md](./plan-playtest.md)** — 17 items
from the 08-05 session with dependency order and work groups, plus §5, the rule
set for specifying them as mini-PRDs for low-cost executors. (It carried a cut
line until 08-08; priority lives in §3's ordering now.)

**The 08-05 entry below is superseded on its central claim.** It says
`ScorerPort` is declared but unbuilt, neither composition root supplies one, and
all 8 units of `score.json` have `predicates: []`. None of that is true in the
working tree: `score.json` carries **9 units, all 9 with predicates**,
`src/driver/scorer.ts:136` builds the port, and both roots wire it
(`src/client/driver/live/bind.ts:84`, `tools/driver/run/bind.mjs:125`). It also
names the unbound meters "c3–c7"; `characters.json` actually leaves **c2–c7**
unbound, 12 of 14 `meters[].variable` null. Meter binding is the only part of
that worklist still open.

**Consequence for the playtest plan:** two of its must items — U3 (the ending)
and showing which sentence moved the agent — were sized as blocked on that work
and are not. What is still missing is a *field*, not a port: `Sentence` is
`{id, text, species, axis?}` (`src/shared/view-driver.ts:18`) with **no
`referent`**, while a gate's key condition is a five-field record carrying one
(`src/shared/datapack.ts:153-158`). Matching a sentence to what it is for needs a
referent the wire does not carry.

## Status (2026-08-05) — the tally ledger is empty, and the reason is authoring, not wiring

**Symptom:** `run_end` opens the TALLY sheet with no score rows — on the live
desk and the headless run alike. The wiring gap is real (`ScorerPort` is
declared in `src/driver/ports.ts` but neither composition root —
`src/client/driver/live/bind.ts`, `tools/driver/run/bind.mjs` — supplies one),
but wiring is not the blocker: **the data is.** Every one of the 8 units in
`data/scenario/우는다리/score.json` has `predicates: []`, and the schema calls
predicates a 하드닝 산출물 — empty is legal at compile time, and
`npm run datapack:lint` already FLAGs all eight as the hardening worklist. The
same worklist shows the character meters unbound (c3–c7: 통제욕 has no state
variable), and predicates need bound variables to read — same piece of work.

**Order of operations** (authoring + engine, not client): (1) bind the
character meters to state variables; (2) author the 8 units' predicates;
(3) implement a `ScorerPort` that evaluates them against `RunState`; (4) wire
it in the two composition roots. The view side is done waiting —
`components/score-tally.ts` renders rows, `windows/tally.ts` carries the
headline axis, and `score.json`'s `baseline_summary` is the 무개입 baseline the
ledger grades against.

**Also fixed on this branch:** `tools/driver/drive-run.mjs` guarded its
entrypoint with a bare `import.meta.main`, which is `undefined` below Node
22.18 — the CLI exited 0 having done nothing, and `test:shared` then failed 13
tests downstream on artifacts that were never written, pointing at missing data
rather than the cause. The guard now falls back to comparing
`pathToFileURL(realpathSync(process.argv[1]))` against `import.meta.url`. The
`realpathSync` is load-bearing: `import.meta.url` is always the resolved real
path while `argv[1]` is whatever the caller typed, so without it the fallback
reads false through a symlink — and `os.tmpdir()` is one on macOS, which made
the shipped-tree test fail in exactly the silent way the fallback removes.

**There is no longer a `import.meta.main` floor**, so `engines.node` is
`>=22.12` — the real dependency floor (vite 8 asks `^20.19 || >=22.12`, and
`--experimental-strip-types` in `test:shared` needs ≥22.6), not the 22.18/24.2
feature floor the bare guard imposed. `.nvmrc` pins 24, matching ci.yml's upper
job. Verified green on v22.16.0 — below the old floor, above the real one.
Deliberately NOT `engine-strict`: the failure below a dependency floor is a
loud install error, and the silent no-op that would have justified a hard block
is the thing this branch removes. CI's Node 22/24 both sit above either floor,
which is why CI could never catch the original.

## Status (2026-08-04) — the proxy is deployed, and the latency budget was wrong

**The tier has made real Bedrock calls.** `nhn-game-proxy` is live in
`ap-northeast-2`; all three call types answered through it. This closes the
08-03 entry's "**Not done: zero real Bedrock calls**".

Getting there took three IAM rounds, and each one was a real defect rather than
a fumble. The bootstrap stack was **reused for the artifact bucket and the OIDC
provider — correctly — but its execution role was reused too, and that role
carries a policy literally named `UpdateLlmLayerResources`**: no
`lambda:CreateFunction`, no `iam:CreateRole`, no `logs:CreateLogGroup`, and an
`apigateway` grant pinned to apothecary's existing API id. It was authored to
*update* one stack that already existed. `proxy/deploy/bootstrap.yaml` is the
second execution role, scoped to this stack's names; the genuinely account-wide
singletons stay shared. Two more actions surfaced only on a create path:
`apigateway:TagResource` (its own action, not covered by the HTTP verbs) and the
`logs:CreateLogDelivery` family (an HTTP API does not write its own access
logs — it registers a vended log delivery).

### First measurements — and the budget they broke

| call | model latency | notes |
|---|---|---|
| judgment | 3.14 · 3.18 · 3.38 · 4.03 s | ~2 490 input tokens; the tier itself adds 3–7 ms |
| narration | 3.59 s | first ever call; `npc_lines` kept id prefixes and the line/room split |
| reporter | 6.80 · 6.95 · 9.20 · 9.54 · 10.00 s | ~1 080 output tokens |

**The reporter did not fit.** Under the inherited 7 s model deadline, 2 of 3
calls returned `504 bedrock_timeout`, and the one that passed did so by writing
16 sentences where `REPORT_GUIDANCE` asks for 20–30 — it beat the clock by
breaking the contract. The three ceilings are now **15 s model < 18 s route <
20 s Lambda**, with the same 15 s bound in `proxy/src/config.ts` so the ordering
cannot be misconfigured from the environment. Re-measured: 5/5 pass, 23–35
sentences.

The old 7 s came from apothecary's "API Gateway waits 9 s, keep 2 s for
validation and fallback". The arithmetic was sound; the premise — that 7 s is
enough for a call this tier had never made — was never tested.

**Nova 2 Lite was measured and rejected.** Same rendered prompt, same
scenario, straight at Converse: 4.19 s mean vs haiku's 7.79 s. But per output
token it is only ~9 % faster (6.60 vs 7.23 ms/tok) — the gap is almost entirely
that it writes **less**: 12–16 sentences against the contract's 20–30, and its
`facts[0]` copied the input line verbatim where haiku rewrote it as a record.
The same saving is available from haiku by asking for a shorter report, which
makes model choice and length policy the same lever. Against that: Nova needs
the loose tool spec (apothecary's `structuredOutputMode` split existed for
exactly this), and every C-BLOCK measurement — 761 judgment calls, the
`p=0.0000595` result — is haiku. Switching would decouple the measured
mechanism from the shipped system six days before the deadline.

**Deploys are automated and hold no secret.** `.github/workflows/proxy-deploy.yml`
assumes `nhn-game-ci-proxy-github` over GitHub OIDC; the developer's 24-hour SSO
session is a *deploy-time* credential only, and nothing in the runtime path
authenticates to AWS at all — the browser posts to a public endpoint, and the
Lambda uses its own execution role. `deploy.yml` (Pages) is untouched.

**Still open:** the endpoint is public and unauthenticated (origin checking is
CORS, not security); the retry budget and the single-origin lock are both
recorded in [README §4](./README.md#4-open-cross-track-items).

## Status (2026-08-03)

**Client track claimed — 민서, minimal-first.** The client layer now has an
owner, closing the "largest schedule risk" row (README §4 ·
[plan-game-design.md](./plan-game-design.md) §7 risk 2 — both flip on their
next revision). Plan is two-phased: **Phase 1** = a minimal working UI that
renders engine output into something visible — its purpose is verifying the
engine, with the UI serving as the test base. **Phase 2** = enhancement
(typography/document-art direction per plan-game-design §6). The layer stays
intentionally minimalistic — there is no frontend developer or designer on
the team; it gives an idea of what could have been, not a blank. Next
artifact on this track: a **UI/UX spec & contract document** that becomes the
SSoT for implementation; until it lands, working decisions live in a local
(untracked) WORKLINE file on 민서's machine.

## Status (2026-08-03) — repo structure settled · the proxy is real

**`infra/` is gone, and `services/` with it.** One folder,
`infra/test-harness/`, was holding the production system prompts, the three
calls' output schemas, the payload composer's prototype, and an embryonic
full-run driver, so none of physical architecture §3.1's boundaries were visible
in the tree. Four roots now, split on what each thing actually is:

| Root | Job | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `src/` | the browser bundle + isomorphic core | browser (+ Node for engine/composer) |
| `authoring/` | datapack compile · lint · type generation | Node, before anything else exists |
| `tools/` | probe runner · beat driver · shared libs | Node, never reachable from index.html |
| `proxy/` | the LLM tier — Lambda → Bedrock | AWS, outside the root install |

Experiment vocabulary (arm, channel, placebo, harness) is confined to
`tools/probe/`. Two undeployed backends moved to `planning/legacy-services/` —
nothing calls either, and the deployed `demos/apothecary/` runs stub-only.

**✅ Decision — the proxy renders both prompt layers** (physical §3.10). The
client posts `{call_type, template_version, slots}`; "user" there is the Messages
API message *role*, not the player. Rendering needs the slot renderers, and the
tool schema is built *from* a slot value, so the renderers and output schemas
followed the templates into `proxy/`. The call contract's executable form went
from three copies to one, and `src/shared/contracts.ts` narrows to the payload
envelope.

The cost is two renderers — the probe measures offline and cannot reach a
Lambda. `proxy/tests/prompt-parity.test.ts` holds them to byte identity;
mutation-tested, 8 of 9 renderer mutations turn it red and the 9th is unreachable
with the current templates.

**Verified across the move:** all three call types compose byte-identical system
and user messages before and after; probe selftest 44/44; proxy 36/36;
`npm run build` green. **Not done: zero real Bedrock calls** — no deploy, no AWS
smoke.

**Run records** go to `artifacts/runs/` and `artifacts/reports/`, committed — not
under `data/`, which is copied into `dist/` (§3.7) and would publish every
measured run to the web.

### TBD audit — what blocks running the tracks in parallel

The criterion is that any interface two work units cross must be specified before
the fan-out, or parallel agents each invent a different signature.

| Boundary | Specified | Missing |
|---|---|---|
| composer ↔ proxy | implemented, 36 tests | the HTTP envelope is in code and READMEs, not in a contract document; `src/shared/contracts.ts` still types the proxy-owned slots as client-supplied and is **stale** |
| state engine ↔ composer | call contracts §6 supplier map | the module interface entirely — no engine snapshot type, no `temperament.json` → prose renderer (the probe uses hand-written `.md` fixtures), and "round event assembler" appears once in a §6 diagram with no owner. **This is the blocker** |
| consumer rules | §6 "Consumer per output" maps where fields flow | what production does with a soft failure, who isolates `inner_note` to Call 3, who appends `timeline_entries` |
| `ui` | plan-game-design §6 brief, explicitly plan-tier | a spec, and the five U-owned parameters in architecture spec §9. The entry above claims the track and names a UI/UX spec & contract document as its next artifact — that is what closes this row |

Also open: the `dist/data` copy plugin (§3.7) still does not exist, and without a
`proxy` transport no measurement has crossed the tier that ships.

## Status (2026-08-02)

**시나리오 확정 + 첫 데이터팩 존재.** 우는다리로 확정(민서 결정), 데이터 트랙
P0가 컴파일러·lint·스키마와 함께 첫 팩을 냈고 **G1이 손으로 하드닝됐다** —
"선정된 초안의 G1"을 기다리던 최소 엔진의 전제 조건이 채워졌다. 남은 빈 필드는
`edge_predicates` 하나이며, 엔진 명세 §4.3이 그 어휘를 고정했다(빈 배열도
유효하므로 엔진 착수를 막지 않는다).

**두 트랙 경계에서 정본의 위치가 바뀌었다.** 데이터팩 타입의 정본은
`data/scenario/_schema/*.schema.json`이고 `src/shared/datapack.ts`는 그
전사다 — TS 타입은 런타임에 지워져 JSON을 검사하지 못하고, 팩은 엔진도 TS
빌드도 없는 시점(compile·lint)에 검증돼야 한다. `contracts.ts`가 계약 문서를
전사하는 것과 같은 구조다. 남은 비용은 전사 drift이며 생성 또는 lint 대조로
갚는다(물리 §3.1).

## Status (2026-08-01)

**Phase transition: demo → production.** DDAY is the selected concept (07-28
decision; the demo bake-off is superseded), so the real build happens at the
**repo root** — this supersedes the earlier `demos/dday/` scaffolding plan.
CLAUDE.md updated accordingly (PR #99). Demos stay deployed at `/<slug>/` as
competition history. Work runs as three tracks per
[plan-pipeline.md](./plan-pipeline.md): **data (민서)** ·
**architecture (윤석)** · **client (미배정)** — agreement works by document,
not discussion. The physical structure wrapping the layers is bound by
[spec-physical-architecture.md](./spec-physical-architecture.md) — tier split,
constraints, and the §3 repo layout are all in force. The minimal engine now
has a spec: [spec-engine.md](./spec-engine.md)
answers the request's five questions and closes call-contract open items
#4 and #5.

## Status (2026-07-30)

**DDAY 기본 메커니즘 확정 — C-BLOCK.** 실제 haiku 호출로 메커니즘 후보를
측정한 결과, 문장 블록 한 줄을 `[알려진 것]`에 주입하면 에이전트의 stance가
`경청 → 공감`으로 9/10 이동했다 (one-sided Fisher `p=0.0000595`). 이것이 게임의
core loop다 — 블록 선택 → 상황 해석 변화 → stance/행동 변화 → 플레이어가 확인.
우선순위 **순서** 조작(C-STRUCT)은 7개 구성·180개 유효 응답에서 목표 방향 효과가
없어 중단했다. **주의: C-BLOCK은 채택됐지만 검증 완료가 아니다** — placebo
control, program-wide negative control, blind coding이 남아 있다. 대외 문구는
"현재 가장 강한 실측 근거를 가진 기본 메커니즘"까지만 쓴다. 프로그램 진입점:
[tools/probe/dday-mechanism/README.md](../tools/probe/dday-mechanism/README.md).

**다음은 측정이 아니라 구현.** 만들 것이 무엇인지는 확정됐다. `demos/dday/`
스캐폴딩과 첫 60초 플레이 루프가 우선이고, 남은 검증 중 게임에 직접 영향을 주는
것은 placebo control 하나다.

## Status (2026-07-29)

**DDAY 컨셉 확정** — the 07-28 team meeting confirmed the D-Day 시뮬레이션 track
(replacing darkest-context as the main line). Scenario: 테러리스트의 전화 **축소
버전**; runtime model: haiku; presentation: text-detective, no spatial movement.
Compact/합성 and prompt-length limits are deferred to Phase-2. Work split
(~07-29 18:30): 윤석 = 기획 문서 (real project spec format), 민서 = 시나리오 축소
+ repo cleanup. **Track SoT: [dday-sot.md](../planning/dday-sot.md)** — start there; it maps
every document, test result, and open decision. Branch `concept/dday-simulation`,
PR #85 open to main.

## Status (2026-07-22)

**Demo phase.** Concept drafting is closed: the 2026-07-22 team meeting consolidated the
6 proposals into 3 tracks. Next, a simple playable demo is built per track under
`demos/<slug>/` (each demo picks its own minimal stack); the final concept is selected by
comparing the demos' plausibility. The repo root is still the engine-agnostic
Vite + TypeScript skeleton — no demo has been scaffolded yet.

## Active tracks

The demo concept tracks are closed — DDAY won. Current tracks are work lanes,
not concepts; owners, questions, and deliverables live in
[plan-pipeline.md](./plan-pipeline.md) §1:
**data (민서)** — formats and transformations · **architecture (윤석)** —
wiring and runtime · **client (민서, 08-03~)** — player-facing surface,
minimal-first.

## Next steps (priority order)

1. **Specify the composer ↔ engine boundary** — the engine snapshot type, the
   `temperament.json` → prose renderer, and where the round event assembler
   lives. See the TBD audit above: this is what blocks the three tracks running
   in parallel. (Root scaffolding is done — §3.8 steps 1–2 and 4 landed 08-03;
   `tsconfig.tools.json` is deferred until `tools/` has a `.ts` file, and the
   `data/` copy plugin is step 3, still open.)
2. **Minimal engine** (doubles as the W4 check) + Bedrock production path. **Its
   first datapack already exists** — `data/scenario/우는다리/`, lint ERROR 0,
   G1 hand-hardened (buckets, deltas, meter bindings to the spec's provisional
   `trust`/`fear`, symptom coverage passing actively). The engine no longer
   waits on anything data-side; target is engine spec §7 criterion 1, one full
   round on that pack. Unit fixtures for the §7 criteria live in test code, not
   in `data/` — including the edge-predicate branches, since G1 ships with an
   empty `edge_predicates` (valid per spec §4.3).
3. **Close the datapack handoff** (pipeline §2 stage 5) — the consuming half of
   [handoffs/datapack.md](./handoffs/datapack.md) §4: suite generator
   eats the G1 card, engine loads the pack. Two of its five items are answered
   by engine spec §4.2–4.3 (`effects` shape, routing vocabulary); one decision
   is open — where `REPORT_GUIDANCE` lives (data track proposes
   `data/policy/report-guidance.json`, outside the pack).
4. First-gate probe (P1), then full-run gameplay measurement (P2).
5. Client track (민서, claimed 08-03): first the **UI/UX spec & contract
   document** — it binds the §9 parameters owned by U (latency budget, report
   cadence ratification, slot count, block-pool curation) and unblocks beat
   granularity (engine spec §8) via the pause structure — then the phase-1
   minimal UI (engine-verification test base).

## Open TODOs

- Verify the exact submission deadline and video editing rules on the official
  competition page (deadline currently assumed ~2026-08-10).
- **Regenerate the nine reference shots — deferred until the UI settles**
  (민서, 2026-08-08). `e2e/reference-shots/` is a visual-regression baseline,
  and seven of its nine frames were rendered 2026-08-05 (`e98ac9e`): they still
  show four windows with the BLOCK STORE, the retired ×1/×4/pause transport
  row, and the AGENT FILE's old block-store slot cards. The `captures` suite
  pairs by NAME only — it never diffs pixels — so a stale baseline is green,
  not red. It costs nothing today and guards nothing either; the moment the UI
  stops moving it should be refreshed, because until then a real visual
  regression has no oracle. One command, run on a build of `main`:
  `CAPTURE_BASELINE=1 SHOT_OUT=e2e/reference-shots npx playwright test captures`
  (the name/count asserts still bind in that mode, so a refresh cannot quietly
  ship eight). The shots are renders of our own UI by our own harness, so they
  are deliberately NOT in `assets-manifest.json`.

## Decision log

- 2026-08-03 — **Removed blocks are discarded, recovered by re-mining**
  (민서·윤석 chat; recorded in spec-architecture §2.1). Slot composition is
  free at build time; no discard inventory. Every past report stays readable
  in the archive, with previously-slotted sentences highlighted; the
  archive's segmentation must not expose gate structure to the player.
  Presentation details bind with the UI pause structure (§9).

- 2026-08-02 — **docs/ reorganised onto three tiers: `spec-` / `contract-` /
  `plan-`.** `spec-` is the normative authority for its domain (breaking it makes
  a downstream artifact defective even if it works); `contract-` is a fixed
  interface between two named owners, carrying a map plus a pointer to where the
  machine-readable law lives; `plan-` is normative about the work rather than the
  artifact. Legend, document map, and the redirect table for old names:
  [docs/README.md](./README.md). Structural consequences: the pipeline document
  split into [plan-pipeline](./plan-pipeline.md) +
  [contract-datapack](./contract-datapack.md) (absorbing the lint ruleset) +
  [contract-run-artifacts](./contract-run-artifacts.md); the answered engine
  request and the 07-29 design doc moved to `planning/`; a live game-design
  document now exists at [plan-game-design](./plan-game-design.md). Two standing
  problems were fixed rather than renamed: call-contracts §8 had three revision
  requests the architecture spec had already absorbed, and cross-track requests
  were scattered across four documents with no single place to see them —
  docs/README.md §4 is now that place. **docs/ is written in English**: its
  primary readers are agents, and the Korean/English split ran straight through
  the binding set.
- 2026-08-02 — **데이터팩 타입의 정본은 JSON Schema**(`data/scenario/_schema/`),
  `src/shared/datapack.ts`는 전사다. 08-01의 "타입은 코드가 정본"을 뒤집는다 —

  빌드가 없는 compile·lint 단계에서 일어나야 하며, "조건당 key example 2개
  이상" 같은 데이터 계약 규칙은 TS로 표현되지 않는다. 대가는 전사 drift이고
  생성 또는 lint 대조로 갚기로 한다. 같은 리비전에서 엔진 명세가 흡수한 것:

  축소(§1.1), 스크립트 비트 순서 규칙(§4.2), **라우팅 어휘**(§4.3),

  concept spec at `docs/game-concept-darkest-context.md` (merges brief + example spec +
  PR #28 review). Decisions: combat/travel view fixed to DD-style side-scroll; cards
  split 3-way Prompt/Skill/MCP (all implemented as sheet prompts, engine executes
  effects); token stays pure currency (stamina idea rejected); jailbreak stays 담당 1기.
  Next artifact: demo PRD.

- 2026-07-22 — Blacksmith absorption executed: apothecary doc gains 단골 아크 (§5.8),
  [정석]/[실험] 조제 (§5.3), 연쇄 결과 (§5.5), 상태 원장 (§6); economy/능력 격차 and
  world-channel expansion dropped (see apothecary 부록 A). Blacksmith doc marked archive.
- 2026-07-22 — 6 concepts consolidated into 3 tracks: agent-roguelike + autobattler
  combined; apothecary absorbs blacksmith; doodle-lab absorbs placement.
- 2026-07-22 — Final concept chosen via demo bake-off, not on paper. The 기획서 template
  and paper-test workflow are retired; those files stay in `docs/` as unreferenced
  archive, and no merged 기획서 will be written.
- 2026-07-22 — Demo layout: `demos/<slug>/`, each with its own minimal stack; the final
  selected game is built at the repo root.
- 2026-07-22 — All 6 concept proposals (`docs/game-concept-*.md`) completed and merged
  before this meeting.
