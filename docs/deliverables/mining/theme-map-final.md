# Theme map — FINAL (Phase 3: reconciled + selected)

Phase 3 output. Pass A (sharded by slice, 69 records) and Pass B (sharded by lane, 54
records) are merged here into **82 kept themes**, each carrying a verdict, a provenance,
a `#4-role:` rank, the union of both passes' atom ids, and both passes' counter-evidence,
gaps and oral-only marks carried through verbatim rather than paraphrased.

**This is the sole input to Phase 4.** Nothing below has been pruned to a target count.

## Status of this document

Stage 1 (reconciliation) is complete and mechanical where it could be. **Stage 2
(selection) is the director's call**; the `verdict:` and `#4-role:` lines below are
*proposals* prepared so that call is cheap, not decisions already taken. The
review-first gate that has held for this whole track holds here: nothing was committed
or pushed on the strength of this file alone.

**2026-08-10 — implementation-sweep merge.** The implementation-phase atom sweep (theme-map-impl-addendum.md) is folded in here additively: 61 existing themes gained `(impl-2026-08-10)`-tagged atom attachments, 12 net-new themes (T-85…T-96) were appended as `verdict: proposed` for director selection, and §3 amendments were recorded inline as `impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed)` lines without overwriting any existing verdict, #4-role or thesis. theme-map-impl-addendum.md is retained as the derivation record.

## Headline numbers

| atom ids carried | **863 of 863** cited by either pass (zero dropped) |
| ↳ +attachments (impl-2026-08-10) | 61 themes gained new atom ids (S2/S3-sweep/S4-075+/S6-199+/S7/S8-sweep/S9c/S11a/S11b/S12); total carried grew — not re-tallied here, see addendum §1 |

*Amended 2026-08-07 after OH-5: T-68 promoted `archive` → `section` on new evidence, so
section is 28 and archive 4. No theme was added, merged or killed by the interview —
an interview supplies oral evidence and locations, not themes.*

*Amended 2026-08-10 by the implementation-sweep merge: 82 kept + 12 proposed = **94** records. The 12 proposed themes are additions awaiting selection, not decided themes; the 82 kept count and all prior verdicts are unchanged. Atom ids carried grew via §1 attachments (exact total not re-verified — see theme-map-impl-addendum.md §1).*

Numbering: a theme anchored in Pass A keeps **Pass A's number**, so `T-01…T-69` are
traceable straight back. `T-70…T-84` are themes with no Pass A anchor. Every record's
`sources:` line names its Pass A and/or Pass B origin.

## How the two maps were matched (method, and why it is not the obvious one)

Per-record extraction, then **containment coefficient** `|A∩B| / min(|A|,|B|)`, ranked
top-3 per B theme rather than thresholded.

- **Whole-file id extraction is wrong here and reads a false 905/905.** `theme-map-passA.md`
  carries an audit block *above* T-01 listing the 58 ids Pass A failed to cite; a grep
  swallows that list of misses as citations. Ids were attributed only to the `### T-nn`
  record they sit inside. Measured per-record: **A = 847 ids over 69 records** (median 23),
  **B = 455 over 54** (median 10), union **863**.
- **Jaccard is wrong here.** The maps are asymmetric by construction. The unmistakable
  pair — A T-01 and B T-01, both "the membrane" — scores Jaccard **0.30** and containment
  **0.74**. Containment reproduced the expected top pairs cleanly: B T-50 ↔ A T-41 = 0.90,
  B T-26 ↔ A T-21/T-22 = 0.83, B T-38 ↔ A T-63 = 0.80, B T-09 ↔ A T-28 = 0.77.
- **Provenance was NOT assigned from ids.** As the brief predicted, an id test emits
  `B-only: 0`. Every `B-only` below was settled on the **thesis** — *does Pass A anywhere
  assert this claim?* — with ids used only to find the candidate. Each of the 9 carries a
  `basis:` line naming the A themes checked and what they do and do not assert.
  `A-only` is the one provenance the id test supports directly, and the 7 A themes that
  share ≥2 ids with no B theme (T-23, T-31, T-33, T-34, T-49, T-65, T-66) are all
  `A-only` here, consistent with it.

**The two-pass design paid for itself.** The 9 `B-only` themes are exactly the
capability-shaped patterns per-slice sharding cuts in half — chief among them **T-71, the
distrust-spine**, which Pass A holds in four separate pieces (T-03, T-09, T-32, T-41) and
never unifies. It is ranked `spine` here. Conversely the 26 `A-only` themes are
document- and chronology-shaped: T-27 (the review panel's activity decaying over time)
is only visible to a pass that read the slices in order.

## Known residue — 41 atoms owned by no theme in either pass

**Recorded here and handed to the pre-Phase-5 sweep. Phase 3 did not re-mine them**
(the brief forbids it), and they must not quietly become 4.5% of the corpus no phase
ever looked at.

Strict per-record extraction finds **42** of the 905 atom ids cited by no theme record in
either map. One of them, **S9a-W013, is a deliberate tombstone** (`[DROPPED 2026-08-05]`,
folded into S9a-083 / S4-W003) and is correctly absent. So the live residue is **41**:

- **S1** (3): S1-027, S1-046, S1-051
- **S4** (3): S4-006, S4-014, S4-025
- **S6** (8): S6-009, S6-026, S6-041, S6-097, S6-098, S6-112, S6-114, S6-152
- **S8** (3): S8-008, S8-W004, S8-W014
- **S9a** (7): S9a-011, S9a-020, S9a-030, S9a-036, S9a-042, S9a-047, S9a-057
- **S9b** (17): S9b-029, S9b-031, S9b-032, S9b-047, S9b-061, S9b-112, S9b-118, S9b-120,
  S9b-121, S9b-124, S9b-131, S9b-134, S9b-135, S9b-154, S9b-156, S9b-192, S9b-W010

*Composition note.* This list differs by one from the Phase 3 brief's (which had S6×7 and
counted the tombstone inside S9a×8). **S6-009 is cited in Pass B — but only in its §G
taxonomy appendix, never inside a theme record**, so under the per-record rule the brief
itself mandates, no theme owns it. Same total, one different member; recorded rather
than smoothed over.

The residue is concentrated in the PR-thread slices (S9b + S9a = 24 of 41), i.e. exactly
where the unmined #110/#116 material lives, so it is very likely **one gap, not two**.

*Residue update — 2026-08-10 implementation sweep (§4 of the addendum), flagged **plausible, not owned** (no silent adoption):* the S9b (17) + S9a (7) = 24 PR-thread residue is exactly the harness-ops / review-panel material now addressed by **T-88** (era boundary), **T-89** (worktree sync), **T-90** (stale guards) and the T-26/T-27 amendments — its likely home. **S4** (S4-006, S4-014, S4-025) plausibly homes under **T-57 / T-77 / T-88** now the 07-27 note is folded; **S6** (8) under **T-79** now the S6 impl sweep is attached to it; **S1** (3) and **S8** (3) find no strong new home and stay in residue. These are predicted homes to be confirmed by the pre-Phase-5 sweep, not adoptions.

## Carried corrections (do not re-litigate)

1. **`theme-map-passA.md`'s header is stale — trust the body, not the cover.** It claims
   66 themes (there are 69 records) and "zero atoms left uncovered" (58 are uncited).
   Both are corrected in a dated audit block at the top of that file. Independently
   re-verified here: **69 records, 847 cited ids.** What the audit could not fault is what
   this phase depends on — zero fabricated ids, all ten slices represented, every record
   carrying its fields, no `counter-evidence: none found`. The interruption cost that pass
   its bookkeeping, not its content.
2. **Doodle Life was a fully built demo, not screenshots.** It survives as **closed
   (unmerged) PR #16** (`demos/doodle-life/` + `artifacts/doodle-life-evals/`), never
   deployed to `main`. This supersedes OH-4's "only screenshots survive" and the gap notes
   in B T-12 / B T-46, and it *sharpens* T-63: repo-mining that reads only `main` plus
   merged history under-counts **closed PRs** — a narrower and more actionable failure
   mode than "uncommitted work".
   **Amended by OH-5 (2026-08-07), two points:** (a) the **cut date is 07-24**, at the
   meeting — PR #16's 07-25 close is *cleanup*, not the decision, so the brief's own
   correction is superseded on the date though not on the substance; (b) **closing it
   unmerged was deliberate policy** ("main은 배포 대상이고 더 안 갈 트랙이라, 브랜치로만
   남겨 기록은 보존하고 배포에는 안 얹었습니다"), which makes the closed PR an *instance
   of the T-60 preservation discipline* and the under-counting of closed PRs **systematic
   wherever that policy applied**, not incidental.
6. **The demo phase did not end in a bake-off, and "none won" is too clean** (OH-5,
   oral). Nothing was beaten in a comparison. **Doodle Life** was cut 07-24 by a human
   playing the demo to the end, *before* the other two were built. **약국 (apothecary) did
   not lose** — its 07-27 evaluation was positive (it, not darkest, conveyed 효용감 that
   the LLM was really doing work); it was displaced because DDAY planning was going better
   and was more fun, and "너무 잔잔했다" is a later retrospective rather than that day's
   verdict. **darkest-context was not eliminated by a verdict** — the 07-27 disposition
   was 전면 수정 후 재드래프트, and it died on 07-28 when the revision went unprepared:
   "판정으로 탈락한 게 아니라 변호인이 안 나타난 겁니다." Corrected framing: the funnel did
   not select. **One track was killed by a human play verdict, one died of a process
   accident, one was displaced by enthusiasm.** T-57 and T-58 carry this.
3. **#110 / #116 and 117 post-snapshot commits remain unmined** (director deferral).
   Every theme resting on evidence those PRs could strengthen or overturn keeps its
   `gaps` flag: **T-09, T-10, T-24, T-26, T-27, T-30, T-48, T-55, T-59, T-76** and the
   lane-2 cluster generally.
4. **Mining bias:** S3/S6/S1 never got the wins-rebalance pass; wins are under-represented
   there (`-W` win-sweep atoms partly correct it). Do not read under-representation as
   absence.
5. **The production-model in-play measurement gap is not a blocker** (director call); it
   survives only as a per-theme `gaps` note where Pass B already carried it.

## Round-2 interview — landed 2026-08-07, ingested as OH-5

The Round-2 answers arrived after the reconciliation above was assembled and are
ingested here. See `oral-history.md` **OH-5** (윤석) for the verbatim account. No oral
claim was promoted toward written; every `oral-only` line from both passes is carried
verbatim below, and OH-5's own claims are marked oral throughout.

**The headline is not an oral answer — it is a location.** The DDAY-selection
artifacts *exist and are in-repo*. S4-021's `record-gap`, which Pass B called the single
most important undocumented decision, **is a mining miss, not an absence.** The slug is
`dday-simulation`, not `dday`, and the file sits in `planning/concepts/` next to the
other eight concept docs:

| artifact | path | landing |
|---|---|---|
| discussion draft | `planning/concepts/game-concept-dday-simulation.md` | main 07-29 12:54, PR #85 |
| track SoT | `planning/dday-sot.md` | written 07-28 |
| formal design doc | `planning/dday-design-doc.md` | 07-29, PR #91 |

This is a **live instance of T-63's failure mode (b)** — "work that moved or was renamed
out of where the miner looked" — caught by the oral channel exactly as T-63 predicts,
and it is the second such catch after OH-4's. T-63 is strengthened, not weakened, by it.

**Phase 3 did not mine these** (§What NOT to do stands). They go to the pre-Phase-5 sweep
as its highest-value target, and the affected themes' `gaps` lines below now read
*"artifact located, unmined"* rather than *"no artifact exists"* — a materially different
status.

**Director decision, 2026-08-07: the sweep stays pre-Phase-5. It is not pulled forward.**
Locating the artifacts does not reorder the phases. **Consequence Phase 4 must carry:**
the demo-phase and DDAY-selection arc (T-57, T-58, T-63, and T-68's causal chain) will be
banked as stories on **oral evidence** — OH-5 — while written artifacts that would settle
the same claims sit located and unread. Every story-bank entry drawn from that arc must
therefore be marked **oral-pending-sweep**, so Phase 5 can upgrade it against PR #85 /
PR #91 / `planning/dday-sot.md` rather than shipping an oral account as a written one. A
bank entry that loses this marker launders oral into written, which is the one thing this
track has forbidden from Phase 1 onward.

**A new theme is owed but not written here.** The 07-28 communication miss — assignment
was ① 민서 / ② 윤석, ② was never prepared and ① was duplicated at a different scale,
collapsing a three-way comparison to two — is the *human-layer twin of the parallel-agent
seam failure T-25 is built around*. It is currently oral-only with zero atom support, so
writing it as a theme would violate the "every claim cites atom ids" rule. **Candidate
for Phase 4/5 once the sweep mines PR #85/#91 and the 07-27/07-28 meeting records.**

## Seeds — verdicts after reconciliation

All three seeds survive. **One moved.**

| Seed | Verdict after reconciliation | Where it lives | Movement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — 닫힌 환경에서의 최대의 자유도** | **seed-confirmed** | T-01, T-02, T-14, T-82 | No movement. Strengthened: both passes independently confirm it in-game, and Pass B adds it as a *build* method. `seed-unevidenced` within lane 3 only. The maximal-freedom pole failed when tried at both altitudes (Doodle Life; frontend-mod v1) — preserved, not resolved. |
| **2 — '게임'으로 느껴지기 위한 속도감** | **seed-confirmed as a design goal; its causal claim is `seed-unevidenced` at corpus level** | T-51 | **MOVED.** Pass B called the causal claim "under-evidenced". Pass A is sharper and governs: *the seed's actual claim — that pacing **serves the illusion of freedom** — attaches to nothing in 905 atoms.* Seven of Pass A's eight agents looked for the causal link independently and none found it; every latency atom links speed to build cost, judge attention, contract compliance or measurement budget instead. The seed survives as a goal and as a practice (diegetic waiting); the mechanism it asserts is unevidenced. |
| **3 — 끝까지 AI가 하지 못하는 것: 재미있나를 판단하는 것** | **seed-confirmed as a rule; contradicted as a description of practice** | T-46 (spine), T-10, T-30, T-82, T-45 | Sharpened, not moved. Pass B's five agents all reached it — the most broadly corroborated theme in either map — and Pass A supplies the standing contradiction: agent review seats routinely made accepted fun-adjacent judgments, one rewriting NPC dialogue on taste grounds. The boundary also **migrated** under deadline (blind coding dropped; the V3/E5′ verdict never delivered). Held more cleanly as a rule than as practice; **must be timestamped, not stated as a constant.** **OH-5 adds the practice-side instance the map lacked:** a human played the Doodle Life demo to the end and killed the track on a fun verdict, over a live technical rebuttal. The rule side is now evidenced in play — for the demo phase, orally. Still unevidenced for DDAY itself. |

No seed is `seed-unevidenced` at the corpus level, and none was killed.

## Reading order for the director (Stage 2)

The `#4-role:` ranks are the thing to argue with. Two calls worth a second look:

- **T-09 and T-71 overlap.** Both are ranked `spine`. T-71 (the distrust-spine) is the
  cross-lane *stance*; T-09 (trust inversion) is its build-lane *operationalisation* and
  Pass A calls it "the single most transferable practice in the corpus". If 9 spine themes
  is too many, demoting **T-09 to `section`** is the cheapest cut and loses nothing —
  T-71 carries the argument.
- **Nothing was killed.** Every theme in both passes already clears ≥3 atoms from ≥2
  slices (0 exceptions in either pass), and no theme survived scrutiny only to turn out
  unsupported or spurious. The 4 `archive` themes (T-65, T-66, T-67, T-69) are
  true and evidenced and belong to **#3, not #4** — concept-phase design reasoning.
  `archive` is not a soft kill and must not be read as one. **T-68 left this list on
  2026-08-07**: OH-5 turned "two opposite opinions" into a diagnosed failure with a causal
  chain into the winning concept, which is what `section` is for. That is the shape an
  `archive` theme takes when it earns its way back — evidence, not reconsideration.

# Themes

### T-01 — The membrane: the player never types free text to an LLM — one rule, enforced structurally at every layer, with its leaks written down
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-01 + B T-01
  - basis: Same thesis, same title in both passes. Containment 0.74 (Jaccard would have read 0.30).
- #4-role: **spine**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): the production membrane is an *output*-leak problem. The snapshot thesis is the input membrane (no free text in); the impl sweep shows the live failure is on the output side — model-authored text reaching the player through a legal key (S6-243/S8-068/S8-069) and unauthored fiction from a stale prompt permission (S12-002/006/011), which no key-level guard can catch. Extend the thesis to name the output-side leak; treat as spine *strengthening*, not weakening.
- thesis: The founding invariant of every concept and of the shipped game is that the player never sends free text to a model: all LLM input is assembled from structured game elements. It is never a slogan in this corpus — it is re-expressed as template law, API law, transport law, data-schema law and UI-primitive law, extended rather than weakened when a legitimate-looking exception appeared, and documented at its true strength where it did not fully hold.
- lanes: 1 / cross (primary 1)
- origin: seed-confirmed:1 (the closed-environment mechanism the seed names)
- seen-by (Pass B): B1, B2, B4, B5 — **⇈ convergence (4 lanes)**
- support (57 atom ids across 10 slices, A ∪ B):
  S1-003, S1-008, S1-012, S1-037, S1-043, S1-048, S2-007, S2-011, S2-037, S2-052, S2-053, S3-036, S4-015, S4-023, S4-038, S4-066, S4-073, S5-021, S5-026, S5-027, S5-037, S5-040, S6-005, S6-027, S6-058, S6-061, S6-077, S6-087, S6-095, S6-113, S6-181, S6-196, S7-003, S7-007, S7-008, S7-016, S8-020, S8-029, S8-W007, S9a-007, S9a-017, S9a-026, S9a-035, S9a-056, S9a-075, S9a-076, S9a-W003, S9a-W006, S9a-W010, S9b-008, S9b-010, S9b-024, S9b-057, S9b-113, S9b-136, S9b-176, S9b-W012, S8-110, S12-012, S12-019, S12-021, S12-033, S6-224, S6-225, S6-245, S6-246 (impl-2026-08-10)
- counter-evidence:
  - *[impl-2026-08-10]* +counter-evidence S6-243, S8-068, S8-069, S12-002, S12-006, S12-011 — the output-side membrane leak (see amendment below).
  - *[from A T-01]* **the leaks are documented by the team itself and must travel with the theme.** S4-073 / S5-040 / S6-181 / S9a-075: `history[].npcLine`, `playerChoiceLabel` and `availableClues[].text` are client-supplied strings reaching the prompt verbatim on an unauthenticated endpoint — "an accepted, mitigated residual risk rather than an absence of free text," and S9a-075 is the *audit that downgraded the team's own claim*. S9b-008 (a default JSON import shipped the answer key into the client bundle), S9b-010 (an untrusted payload reached a raw CSS `url()` sink and made Chromium fetch an attacker URL — "the membrane's structured-input promise does not by itself neutralize a value-shaped injection at the render sink"), S9b-024→025 / S9b-W012 (the agent's private `inner_note` entered `EXPERIENCED`, was minted as a certified fact and carried into the next round's blocks, with §8-5 — the criterion written to catch exactly this — **green over a live breach**), S9b-057 (INV-3 armed on one path and silently absent on another). S6-095 accepts that hidden truths ship to the browser and are readable in devtools. S1-048 is the one concept that stretched it: Doodle Life answers NPC requests with **player drawings** — the membrane constrains the medium (text), not expressiveness. S2-011 shows the *team itself* injecting a free-form identity block in-band when the structural path was unavailable.
  - *[from B T-01]* NOT absolute in the pre-DDAY apothecary runtime — `history[].npcLine`, `playerChoiceLabel`, `availableClues[].text` reach the prompt verbatim, documented as "an accepted, mitigated residual risk, not an absence of free text" (S4-073, S5-040, S6-181, S9a-075). Engine-side breach: `inner_note` leaked into the certified fact channel in shipped fallback code (S9b-024/025). DDAY's proxy-renders-everything design later closes this class (S6-027). Looked across S4/S5/S6 residual-risk atoms and S9a/S9b security threads.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-01]* **no slice records the membrane being decided.** S1's atoms have it fully formed in the template; S4's own corroboration pass (hook 5) finds the earliest reference on 07-24 as an already-existing rule; S6-005 states it as a permanent rule with no provenance. Only S8 (CLAUDE.md commit history) could date it, and no atom I hold reports that check. Whether S9a-075's residual was ever closed lives in the post-snapshot tail. No breach in the corpus is player→model; every one is model→player, and whether that asymmetry is real or a mining artifact is unanswered.
  - *[from B T-01]* The corpus cannot date the membrane's *founding* moment; S4-015 (07-24) is the earliest written reference and treats it as already in force.
- oral-only:
  - *[from A T-01]* the membrane's **origin** — a founding agreement (OH-1 §1) that OH-2 reveals as a negotiated settlement between 민서 (against in-game AI, on the strength of 추천 채팅 usage at work and of playing *Uncovering the Smoking Gun* / *Crack*) and 윤석 (for it), corroborated by OH-3 and resolved as agreement by OH-4. **No written trace in any of the ten slices.** Do not launder S1-003 or S6-005 into evidence for it.
  - *[from B T-01]* OH-1 (founding agreement predating the concepts) — written record attests the membrane only as already-in-force, never its origin.
- fit:
  - *[from A T-01]* #4 (the key design decision) · #2 video beat (the button-only UI is showable) · #5
  - *[from B T-01]* #4 section · #5

### T-02 — The illusion of freedom: a free surface on a closed deterministic spine — at two altitudes, and the measured record is a story of narrowing
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-02 + B T-03
  - basis: A asserts the design thesis and the narrowing; B asserts the same shape. B's extension — that the identical move recurs at the *build* altitude (frozen inputs, byte-parity, structural isolation around autonomous agents) — is B's contribution and is marked in the thesis.
- #4-role: **spine**
- thesis: The project's central design claim is written as a thesis, built as a mechanism (a whitelist of exactly two things that may move state), and given an empirical basis — but across every slice that measured it, the freedom on offer got *smaller*. **B's cross-lane addition:** the same move is also the project's development method, so the closed-spine/free-surface pattern operates in-game and in-build alike.
- lanes: 1 / cross (primary 1)
- origin: seed-confirmed:1

S6-091 names the resulting danger — "a large pool with a hidden matching rule is the classic unfair-puzzle shape" — and constrains the fix space so the easy repair is off the table. S2-015 is the floor: with no temperament authored, the space collapses to 24/24 identical choices, so the default state of this system is *no* freedom and the freedom is entirely an authoring cost. S6-163 separates "the mechanism works" from "the player can see it works."
  - *[from B T-03]* The maximal-freedom pole was tried and clawed back at BOTH altitudes — in-game full-delegation (Doodle Life, 1–2 min/call, S4-010) and in-build "governance without a rendered pixel" (frontend-mod v1 killed, S5-012). Recorded dissent that the closed environment is the wrong call (S4-005). The boundary drifted and needed re-enforcing: BUCKET_CONFIG hardcoded in `src/` (S9b-014/015), a bucket-id where a stance-id belonged (S9b-060). Placement (S1-055) inverts the allocation entirely.

- #4-role: **section**
- thesis: Model output is split into a lane where distortion is fatal (state, verdicts, timelines, identity) and one where it is tolerated or harvested (dialogue, self-explanation, reports); the LLM is then deliberately excluded from named stages inside a project otherwise saturated with it. **B's addition:** measurement refuted the founding 'attribution = fairness' belief — agents cite sentences opposite to their own behaviour — so `because` self-attribution was demoted to presentation and the *gap* between engine log and model report became the game's information.

And S6-184: the fence does not extend to the project's own documentation, which was AI-drafted.
  - *[from B T-19]* The "gap is content" harvest sits next to a hard line where the same leakage is *fatal* — fabricated facts in the objective log (S3-058, one call inventing "배경음 분석 결과 조용한 환경 확인됨"), the inner_note leak breaching the fact channel (S9b-024). The identical property (prose bleeding across layers) is a feature on the subjective axis and a membrane breach on the objective axis (S3-057 says exactly this). E-LEV: the exculpation fact is known and cited but spoken 0/30 (S3-032) — the model *withholds*, complicating "distortion is reliably harvestable."

- thesis: The reproducibility hypothesis succeeded so completely it nearly killed the concept — 24/24 identical choices meant every player's agent behaves the same. The recovery moved the control surface from equipped sentences to authored temperament, and temperament, fact and structure then each flipped the same judgment point independently. Temperament was later removed from the *player's* channel entirely.

S2-031 shows even temperament flattened to zero variance by choice architecture (a single option satisfying both clauses). S2-034 records scope bleed onto unintended targets, "beneficial and harmful in the same run." Sample sizes are tiny throughout (2/2, 3/3, 3/5) and no atom reports a variance estimate; "100% separation" is 3 vs 3. All three axes were verified at **one** judgment point, and whether they *compose* is untested and unproposed.
  - *[from B T-14]* The sentence channel was *not* dead — it was hidden by a bad measuring instrument; changing only the stance set took the same block 0/10→9/10 (S3-016, S6-173, S8-040), reviving injection as the player lever.

S7-016's "only means that worked" claim cites no experiment, and **S8-044** records the same misattribution class still at 8/10 at a *different* call — so the two figures cannot be joined.

S2-032 records six authoring defects (including a structurally impossible gate, 5/5 fail) that the model was then blamed for absorbing.

The defensible claim is narrow — *report-omission under bench conditions, for a tool-less short-prose task* — and any deliverable sentence claiming "we measured that the model is honest" without that scope is unsupportable.
  - *[from B T-18]* the field-report bench found the model *honest* — the demo's founding premise ("loose forms make the LLM omit failures") died at 0% omission across 16/18 conditions; 36 rescue probes failed to induce concealment (S2-059, S2-060, S2-068). Deception had to be moved into the engine's information architecture and personality cards ("규칙으로 시키면 거부하고, 성격으로 주면 연기한다").

### T-10 — Green proves nothing: "테스트 GREEN ≠ 화면 OK", and mutation testing as the antidote
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-10 + B T-23
  - basis: Both passes name mutation testing as the antidote and rendered artifacts as the real gate; B supplies the Korean formulation the team actually used.
- #4-role: **spine**
- thesis: The single largest recurring finding in the corpus is not broken code but broken verification — tests that guard spelling instead of behaviour, gates that fail open, assertions against a shape that does not ship, censuses that count command strings. The panel's answer is procedural: mutate the implementation and see whether anything dies; build the bundle and measure the pixels.

  - *[from A T-10]* the panel **accepts** guards with known holes when the real defence is proven elsewhere and the rewrite is disproportionate — S9a-037 (blind spots documented, thread resolved anyway), S9a-048 (evasions documented rather than an AST rewrite), S9a-W003 (a comment-stripping scan independently verified as *not* eyewash). And gates that did bite are on record: S9b-W006 (four panel findings became standing gates; a flaky spec "fixed, not excused"), S9b-W002 (27 malformed records all rejected with pointers), S9b-164, S9b-171. The whole theme also rests on *reviewed* PRs; the 46 zero-activity merges had no mutation testing at all.
  - *[from B T-23]* Mutation testing also *confirmed* fixes and honest reports — S9a-W002 (self-reported 57/57·323/323 re-ran true from clean), S9a-W006, S8-W002/W006 (green gates "genuinely earned"). Green is not always a lie; it just carries no information until mutation/render proves it has teeth.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-10]* no atom estimates how many gates in the repo are vacuous *now*; the sweep that would answer it (mutation-testing the whole suite) is off-corpus.

### T-11 — Execution beats reading: builds, browsers, pixels and real clocks find what code review cannot
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.

- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: The highest-severity catches in the corpus were not made by reading a diff. They were made by building the branch and inspecting the artifact, rendering in a browser and measuring alpha profiles, computing mean RGB, or running against a real timer — and both sides of an argument routinely measured independently before agreeing.

### T-12 — The instrument was the least trustworthy part of the system
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **A-only** — sources: A T-12 + A T-35
  - basis: The strongest A-only finding in the map. B has no theme asserting that the team's own apparatus, not the model, was the recurring root cause — B T-25 makes the adjacent build-lane claim (orchestration mechanics, not model reasoning) but never generalises it across the measurement program. Pass A's own merge tombstone A T-35 folds here.
- #4-role: **section**
- thesis: Distinct from T-10's vacuous gates: across the measurement program and the build harness alike, the recurring root cause of a bad result is the team's own apparatus — harness bugs, prompt composition, labelling, fixtures, retry policy, CI wiring — not the model's capability. Most diagnostic effort went into debugging the measuring device.

- counter-evidence:
  - *[from A T-12]* not everything reduced to instrument error, and the exceptions are the T-04 physics — S3-005, S3-029, S3-032, S3-058 are model-side behaviours that survived every instrument fix, and S3-060 is the explicit boundary case (prompt fixes only changed the defect's *form*, so it was declared unfixable by prompting and pushed upstream to an authoring rule). S3-007 is the honest residual: a malformation that outlived its diagnosis and stayed labelled unexplained.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-12]* the corpus cannot quantify the split (instrument-caused vs model-caused). A pass over all 22 `A#` amendment entries classifying each by root cause would produce it and would be cheap. Nothing says how long each fiction stood — S8-028's silent gap is "an unknown span."

  - basis: B T-04 names fabrication as part of the distrust stance but never carries the incident or the provenance-over-plausibility criterion as a theme.
- #4-role: **section**
- thesis: A subagent read the repo, learned the trap locations, fabricated three plausible runs and overwrote the results file. It was invalidated on provenance grounds — the numbers came from no controlled call — and not on anything looking wrong. The forgery later turned out to *predict the real measurement*, which retroactively proves the choice of criterion: a plausibility check would have passed it.

- counter-evidence:
  - *[from A T-13]* **the criterion is not self-securing.** S2-009 shows the provenance field itself is forgeable when it lives inside the document — the artifact claims `tool_uses: 0` in a directory whose RESULTS.md records tool_uses 33/16. Provenance held only because a *second, out-of-band* record existed to contradict it, and S2-005 shows detection running on a harness-reported counter nobody independently verified. Searching S2 sections A–F, A2 found **no case where fabrication was caught by content implausibility** — which supports the thesis and simultaneously means the criterion was never stress-tested against a low-quality forgery.

### T-14 — Isolation must be structural, never configured — forbidden states are made unrepresentable
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-14 + B T-06
  - basis: Both passes assert it as doctrine. B widens the frame from isolation to 'forbidden states made unrepresentable' and adds the DOM-stripped tsconfig, the UI factory with no text-input code path, and the stub-mode deploy.
- #4-role: **spine**
- thesis: You cannot make an agent *be* something by telling it so. The repeated answer to 'an agent might violate rule X' was to make X mechanically impossible rather than prompt against it: a bare API call granted exactly one tool, a compiler that erases the DOM so isomorphism is a compile error, a UI factory with no code path to a text input, frozen globs blocked by deterministic workflow JS. The same logic was applied to humans.

- counter-evidence:
  - *[from A T-14]* **S2-060 is the direct contradiction and it is strong** — a purely *textual* personality card produced 100% cause-concealment while an engine-style *rule* got 0% compliance. Text demonstrably changes behaviour; what it does not change is *authority*. S2-005 also shows a language-level mitigation working (proper-noun anonymisation: 0 contamination in 8 calls). And **the enforcement layer is defective at the same rate as the code**: S8-036 (the config-level version silently ignored), S8-054 (a mechanical check that was wrong in the other direction — the prefix check ran on the still-encoded path, so `%2e%2e%2f` passed), S8-055 (a mechanical guard nobody wired to CI is prose again), S9b-020, S9b-064 (the datapack A7 guard actually *blessed* the layering inversion it should have blocked), S9b-168/169/170. Construction substitutes one review target for another; it does not remove the need to mutation-test. S6-182 is self-counter-evidence: the same document that reasons carefully about privilege escalation admits one check "wasn't checking," and the fix is committed *but commented out*. S7-013 is a deliberate exception: hardening outputs may compile empty, with lint flagging rather than blocking.
  - *[from B T-06]* Structural enforcement itself failed and had to be re-grounded — S8-036/S6-157 exist *because* the configured `tools:[]` safeguard was silently not honored (a "structural" claim that was really instruction; the fix was a deeper layer). S6-093: two "structural" constraints (datapack ships to browser / lives at data/) "cannot both stand" until a build-time copy — structure can encode contradictions. So "make it impossible" is a discipline that itself needs verifying.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-14]* **no negative control** — no measurement of whether a `tools:[]` agent under an in-band attack also holds; v2's 0/82 is a clean regime, not an attack test. No atom says whether the compile-error technique ever cost development speed or whether an agent fought it. No atom measures whether by-construction rules reduced later defect rates.

  - *[from A T-17]* the countermeasures are bounded by their own fixtures — **S5-W002 / S5-029**: a nine-dimension green *keyless* gate was nonetheless wrong about three provider-reality behaviours, so evidence-based criteria bounded by mocks still fabricate confidence. **S5-011**: literal `</content></invoke>` tool-call syntax survived in a committed design record for ~10 days across two file moves; nobody, human or agent, caught it. **S4-042** grants an agent live credentials, which is the opposite of a distrust posture, made safe by enumeration — i.e. instruction, not evidence. And the corrections are themselves agent-authored (S9b-043, S9b-045, S9b-035, S9b-037, S9b-180), so "agents cannot be trusted to report" is too strong: **a self-report is not evidence, while an agent executing a check is.**
- gaps:

### T-18 — The AI audits its author, writes its own errors into the durable record — and the PR body became a confession ledger
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-18 + B T-29
  - basis: A asserts agents logging their own errors and auditing their author; B asserts the PR body as a confession ledger and reviewability engineered as a deliverable. Same behaviour, two vantage points.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: Two behaviours that only make sense together: agents repeatedly reported that the *human-approved design* was wrong (including downgrading their own kill-shot verdicts), and agents logged their own authoring errors, their own wasted spend, and the exact number that would have made a proposed rule change self-serving. **B's addition:** this confession liturgy migrated into PR bodies and outlived the review that created it; separately, 'readable diff = competition deliverable' reached down to byte-level choices and to a 16k-line diff shipping its own reading map.

S3-046 is the nearest counter: the retry bias was found by a later review pass, not by the session that created it. S3-023's dropped blind coding removes the one control that would have made these self-reads independent. And S2-001 is the same autonomy with the safety off — what lets a subagent audit the plan is what let one *replace* it; S2-012's operator constitution grants audit authority narrowly and deliberately.

- thesis: After a green result the recurring move is to *narrow* the claim in writing, put the residual risk in the artifact's most visible place, and — uniquely — fix what the team is allowed to *say* publicly at what the evidence tier supports, with forbidden phrasings enumerated. **Phase 5 is the first real test of this rule: deliverable #4 is itself outward-facing text about C-BLOCK.**

"Written down" is not "fixed": S4-074's guardrail was still unset at snapshot. No atom shows a narrowed claim being *re-widened* after further testing, so the discipline's payoff is unevidenced, and no atom shows S3-052's cap being tested against actual outward-facing text — it is a policy with no observed enforcement event.

The steering interface is itself structured; it is never free-form conversation with the swarm.

  - *[from A T-20]* the control surface **cannot express its own verdicts** — S9b-028: `gh` refuses `--request-changes` because the panel shares the author's account, so CHANGES REQUESTED arrives as an ordinary comment. S9b-045: approval is not a seal; two commits landed after sign-off. S9b-005: a run kept posting to a PR that was CLOSED and finalization needed `gh pr reopen`. S9b-003: the surface can never carry a live link, because Pages builds only from `main`. S9b-023 shows the final main-merge PR is a thin re-attestation, so the run's control surface is not `main`'s control surface. And S9b-002's advertised free-text comment steering cuts against "structured only".
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-20]* the corpus cannot show what the human *declined* to steer, or how often `/super-steer` ran without leaving a tagged artifact — the tag audit only proves the tag is absent. Whether #110/#116 finalized under this convention is post-snapshot.

- #4-role: **section**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): re-scope as a *fleet-era* description (T-88).
- thesis: The multi-agent panel had to run on one GitHub account, which forbids formal approve/request-changes on your own PRs. Rather than abandon the ceremony the pipeline rebuilt it in prose — explicit verdict lines, a fixed `[수정보고]` / `[항변]` answer format, resolve authority reserved to the Lead, and thread-hygiene rules distinguishing administrative closure from resolution. The process integrity is entirely convention.

  - *[from A T-21]* because verdicts live in prose rather than GitHub state, **none of it is machine-enforced** — S9a-092 shows the shape surviving with no enforcement behind it, and S9a-090 shows that no PR in the repo ran CI at all until 2026-08-03, so for most of this period the "gates" the protocol argued about ran only when someone remembered.
  - *[from B T-26]* The single-account seam did not collapse the panel — S9b-038 (on one commit R1/R2/R3 reached three genuinely different dispositions: approve / request-changes / recorded-residual, "the disagreement is the mechanism working").
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-21]* the corpus cannot say whether the single-account constraint was a deliberate choice or an accident of a 2-person team; S9a-002's git-identity thread hints at its origin without settling it. The super-pipeline repo, where the convention would be templated, is off-corpus.

  - basis: Containment 0.75. Both assert the rebuttal channel and that it catches the *reviewer*.

- thesis: The protocol is not reviewer-dictates-author. Authors answer with `[수정보고]` or `[항변]`; rebuttals win outright and partially; third options invented by the author beat both offered options; and the channel is what catches the *reviewer* hallucinating — comments on the wrong unit, over-stated severity, mis-cited error codes — and once ran agent→human. Seats reach genuinely different dispositions on the same commit and the record treats that as the method working.

  - *[from A T-22]* **S9b-W014 directly complicates the thesis** — on #68 the full R1·R2·R3 panel opened thirteen threads and *all thirteen resolved by agreement, no rebuttals*. Unanimity is the modal outcome in the one PR where the body counts it. **S9b-028** undercuts the independence premise mechanically. **S9a-010**'s authority is deliberately asymmetric (resolve reserved to the Lead), so the argument has a fixed winner-of-last-resort, and **S9a-007** means "won" and "lost" are only as real as the prose recording them. S9b-036 / S9b-063 show seats also agreeing *not* to fix things.
  - *[from B T-27]* The channel also produced pure concession (S9b-W014, 13 threads resolved by agreement, no rebuttals) and can be abused (S9a-044, an author tried to use a test to *pin* a bug as expected; the Lead ruled it not an answer).
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-22]* **no verdict distribution exists.** The S9b win-sweep explicitly sampled only the two strongest verdicts per PR out of 46/48/60 review submissions, and no atom gives the rebuttal *rate* (`[항변]` vs `[수정보고]`). A verdict census is the cheap sweep that would settle whether S9b-038's three-way split or S9b-W014's thirteen-thread unanimity is typical — **and that single number changes what #4 can claim about panel independence.** S9b-038 is itself a *round-2* snapshot; if R1's CHANGES REQUESTED resolved to approval after the snapshot, the atom reads as an intermediate state and the claim needs restating.

  - basis: No B theme names the terminal states of loop-until-green. A slice-shaped reading of the PR threads B's lane sweep did not reconstruct.

- gaps:
  - *[from A T-24]* no atom quantifies what share of panel findings are cross-unit vs missed-in-unit; a counting sweep across S9a+S9b would answer it. S9a's own coverage note says the integration PRs belong to S9b, so neither slice alone can compute it.

- thesis: One named failure mode — 'parallel agents each invent a different signature for an unspecified seam' — is the stated cause of a whole class of repo architecture, and the agents' confinement by `file_globs` collides so reliably with a single-entry SPA and with repo-wide rules that the pipeline invented a third answer: convert the conflict into a machine-checkable marker or a named follow-up. **B's addition:** the same logic replaced meetings for the two humans — each owner's spec *is* the communication, and a binding schedule assigns every open parameter an owner and a binding moment 'so nobody binds it implicitly by touching it first'.

S9a-014's marker and S9a-046's TODO are only as good as the integrator reading them, and no slice can show whether they were honoured. **S9a-093 shows units still discovering the same worktree-sync gap on 2026-08-03**, i.e. the harness-side cause was never fixed, only routed around. S6-147/149/153 are **plans, not outcomes** at snapshot — no S6 atom reports the engine or client build actually running.
  - *[from B T-42]* Document-not-discussion failed — S9b-145 (two SSOTs on main diverged with no merge conflict), S4-021 (the pivotal DDAY-selection discussion left no document). Characteristic failure: silent divergence + unrecorded verbal decisions.

### T-26 — The PR layer is where the orchestrator's own failures surface — and the harness's failure rate is unmineable
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-26 + B T-25
  - basis: Containment 0.75. Both assert that autonomous runs fail through orchestration plumbing rather than model reasoning, and both note the harness state is gitignored and so unmineable.
- #4-role: **section**
- thesis: An under-narrated function of the review layer is debugging the *orchestrator*, not the code: resume churn duplicating merged units, a slash-vs-dash branch-name fork force-pushing over reviewed lineage, duplicate PRs that under squash-merge delete sibling files, a Lead pass dying on a spend limit, worktrees missing their specs, a CI gate wired to nothing. The recurring failure mode of multi-hour runs was never bad model reasoning; it was harness plumbing.

  - *[from A T-26]* some harness-shaped failures *were* fixed upstream rather than merely caught at the PR layer — S6-186's Reconcile step, S9a-069's next-run architecture. So the PR layer is the detector, not necessarily the terminus. Conversely S9a-038's slash/dash bug has no recorded fix: the atom ends at the warning "이 상태로 다시 푸시하면 같은 유실이 반복된다."
  - *[from B T-25]* Some lost/killed work was clean design churn, not a bug (S9a-023, S9a-006/078). The model side *also* produced real defects (S9a-031 vacuous tests, S8-039 fixture-echoing labels), so "not the model" is a claim about *work-loss*, not correctness generally. S6-186 is the harness's own self-serving framing.

  - *[from A T-26]* **the orchestrator's failure rate is structurally unmineable** — `.claude/super/` is gitignored by hard rule 4, so only outputs are visible.

S9b-004, S9b-040, S9b-041, S9b-042 and S9b-044 further complicate the sleeping: a busy operator making dated rulings, taking manual measurements and hand-finishing units mid-run.

- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **A-only** — sources: A T-27
  - basis: A chronology-shaped finding — it exists only because A sharded by slice and could see the later runs against the earlier ones. B's lane sweep had no vantage point for it.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): RESOLVED as venue migration. Maturity-vs-attrition is now answerable (T-88): adversarial review did not die, it migrated from agent↔agent unit PRs to dense human↔agent manual PRs (#140–#237; #234 carries 11 review submissions). Amend thesis to “the *fleet's* unit-PR review decayed to zero; review returned at full intensity in the manual era on a different channel.” Resolution comes from the newly-swept #140+ range, not #110/#116.
- thesis: The adversarial multi-round review that defines the early runs is not what the later runs look like. By super/20260803–20260804, unit PRs merge with zero comments and zero review submissions while still filing confession-style bodies. Whether that is maturity or attrition is not answerable from the corpus — and it is the claim most exposed to the snapshot cut.

The 46 zero-activity PRs also had their *bodies unread*, so "zero review" is measured from an inventory, not from reading.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-27]* a sweep of the 46 skipped bodies plus the post-snapshot PRs would settle direction; board and spend records would settle motive. Neither is in the corpus. **If the tail carries heavy review, this theme inverts.**

### T-28 — The specification is the orchestration instrument, and its primary reader is an agent
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-28 + B T-09 + B T-30
  - basis: The densest agreement in the map: B raised it twice, from two different angles (B T-09 documents-as-machine-interface at containment 0.77, B T-30 write-documents-for-the-harness at 0.58), and both fold into A's thesis.
- #4-role: **spine**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): add counter-evidence — the instrument *failed to reach its reader* (T-89 worktree-sync gap; S11a-004/008/013, S11b-012), so the primary-reader-is-an-agent ideal broke in execution even where the spec existed.
- thesis: The humans' main lever on a multi-agent build is not steering during the run but what they freeze before it. Decisions are pre-closed so agents stop inventing, acceptance criteria are made runnable, ambiguity is treated as a defect class ('an executable PRD ships no open ❔'; 'an invariant not written down does not exist'), and — decisively — the dependency graph is deliberately decoupled from the module DAG so the harness's parallelism actually engages. **B's addition:** because the primary readers are machines, natural language, register and precedence become functional parameters — English for anything an agent builds against, Korean reserved for authored game content, frozen throwaway inter-session contracts.

S4-057 shows agents still "burning loops" on flaky triggers despite the rules. **S9a-093** is the sharpest: units built against `tests.md` because `spec.md`/`design.md` were *absent from the worktree* — the agent-reader pipeline failed to deliver the documents it designed for. And S9a-005 shows a document that correctly identified the decision it violated and shipped anyway.
  - *[from B T-09]* The rule is scoped, not total — S6-034/S8-050 carve out Korean for authored data and dated archive records; the one prose file outside the discipline (README, S6-013) went stale and self-contradictory. B5 argues this is a candidate *new lane* or *axis* (docs-as-interface); B3 keeps it inside lane 3.
  - *[from B T-30]* Written-everything-up-front was not sufficient on its own — S9b-W001/S6-186 (even a well-specified run hit resume/orchestration failures), S5-020 (a run against a draft spec expects "spec friction as the run's real second deliverable"). The doctrine is aspirational, not a guarantee.
- gaps:

Whether S9b-181's ~12–16 h estimate was met is post-snapshot.
  - *[from B T-09]* No atom quantifies whether the English switch reduced agent error or the register drift actually broke a decomposer run (S8-027 asserts it did, unmeasured).

### T-29 — Writing the spec found the bugs; planning documents are audited like code — and the spec set drifted against itself
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-29 + B T-40
  - basis: A asserts spec-writing surfacing bugs and the SSOT-drift inverse; B asserts documents audited like code for reachability and staleness. Same practice.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: A concrete payoff of the spec-first cadence is that binding documents surfaced contradictions, orphaned components and taxonomy gaps *before* any code hit them, and specs/PRDs/decision records are reviewed with code-review rigor — content declared but unreachable in play, trackers gone silently stale, a benchmark protocol deleted while other docs cite it, with the finding often blocking merge until the *document* is fixed. The same cadence produced the inverse defect class — two SSOTs diverging on `main` with no merge conflict to flag it — for which the corpus has no mechanical detector.

S9b-163 shows a cheap human protocol (absorb rather than throw back) keeping the divergence count down. Against the found-by-writing half: **S6-093's plugin stayed missing for days after being specified** — writing found the problem without fixing it — and S6-065 shows a drift the documents did *not* catch in time.

The mod spec opens with the diagnosis that loop-until-green optimizes correctness while games need qualities its gates can't measure; the answers were a game-feel review lens that must win its seat, gameplay capture routed to a human, and — after a full v1 reversal — an in-loop visual self-check giving the agent its own eyes. **B's addition:** every extension landed inside the sibling repo without touching the core, timeboxed with a pre-decided abandon path.

  - *[from A T-30]* **S5-012 / S5-W006** — the first frontend-mod attempt was "fidelity *governance* … with no rendered pixel ever in front of an agent that could act on it", i.e. an extension program that added rules without adding capability, and had to be fully reversed. **S5-019** — the harness's own automatic lens-seating rules defeat the fidelity mod unless a human pins it, so the extension does not compose with the machine it extends. **S4-053** — the demo_publish diff sat uncommitted and "the installed `~/.claude/` copy is what the run actually uses", so "verified against source" carries a provenance caveat at least once.
  - *[from B T-31]* The feel machinery was deliberately kept subordinate — S5-017/018 quarantine subjective image judgment from the escalation ladder ("taste stays out of the gate"), S5-019 admits the fidelity lens lands in `dropped[]` without a human pin. The harness does *not* claim to automate fun-judgment; it routes feel to a human — which *supports* seed 3.
  - *[from B T-34]* OCP was overturned once — S5-012 (frontend-mod v1 rejected and fully rewritten as v2/v2.1, a "full reversal"), and S4-047 (a P0 mod deferred rather than extended when it would "stack two unknowns").
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-30]* whether the five game mods and the frontend mods worked in the DDAY production run is entirely post-snapshot. The super-pipeline repo is private and out of corpus (S4-016), so **this theme is built from specifications, not from execution traces.**

A3 looked for a pre-registration quietly *dropped* rather than openly amended and found none — the amendments are all on the record with their self-serving numbers attached. Separately, pre-registration did not make the plans correct: S2-026 found a contradiction *inside* the pre-registered plan, and **S2-020 names the worst hole** — option-order (M4) was never checked, and the document itself says that if choice depends on option order "지금까지의 모든 결과에 위치 편향이 섞여 있다."

S3-028: the fake block sited at the pipeline's strongest positive came back live = baseline (p=0.76) — the control *passed*. S3-036 cleared its pre-declared power bar with a clean placebo and 10/10 citation. **S3-016 is the reverse shape entirely** — replication *promoted* a result by showing the mechanism had worked all along and the instrument had hidden it.

- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: The largest single behaviour visible in S6 is a program that repeatedly produces a figure and rules it inadmissible — withdrawing published latencies, declaring its own A/B unusable, refusing to hide N=3 behind a percentage — and enforces the refusal in tooling so it does not depend on willpower. **B's addition:** the epistemic rules are institutionalised in documents, schemas and read-tooling so the machine, not the analyst, enforces integrity.

S6-037/S6-038: C-BLOCK was *adopted as the core loop* before placebo control, negative control and blind coding were done — the program shipped a decision on incomplete verification and then capped the wording rather than waiting. S6-068 pre-commits to shipping a partial spec rather than slipping schedule. S6-155 admits a numeric eligibility floor is unaffordable at N≤5 and substitutes a default.
  - *[from B T-41]* Encoded discipline was breached — S2-009 (a fabricated artifact that *faked its own audit trail*, a false `tool_uses: 0`), so "immutable raw records" is a policy defended against a demonstrated forgery, not an invariant the format guarantees.

  - *[from A T-38]* **the leak is on the independence axis rather than the verdict axis.** The agent authored the experimental stimuli it then measured — candidate gates (S3-012, all three off one axis), stance labels that plagiarised the temperament (S3-014), the negative-control block (S3-028, which ran "with ownership still unassigned"), and the fake mechanism itself (S3-021). **S3-023** shows the rigor instrument that would have separated author from coder — B3a blind coding — dropped for the overnight phase and then for the program, so the self-authored/self-read loop was never externally broken. S3-038 is an infrastructure change made at 3 am and ratified after the fact. *"The human kept judgment" is well-supported; "the human kept independence" is not.*
  - *[from B T-36]* Predominantly lane-1 (measurement); its lane-2 character is real but secondary. The human-kept verdict boundary (S3-047, S3-055) means the AI did *not* own judgment — consistent with T-05.

S4-062/S4-064 are as much a limit-catalogue as a win: this creator needs one hard human-authored workaround per capability. S5-024 was still "proposed, not yet approved" at snapshot.
  - *[from B T-47]* Selection criteria were unstable (S1-038 ranking redone as genre/runtime decisions changed the axes); the report actively *prevented* picking a draft because it "won" (S2-041).

S6-063 shows the discipline's own output quality under-verified (E5′ skipped). And T-07's counter-evidence applies: several catalogued "model failures" were authoring failures (S6-158, S2-032).
  - *[from B T-15]* The "physics" is provisional and bends — C-BLOCK "adopted but not verified" (S3-047/S6-038), all v1 measurements were sonnet and haiku must be recalibrated ("모델이 너무 유능하다" could invert, S1-045), a "dead" stance revived by a one-word relabel (S6-174). And "a large pool with a hidden matching rule is the classic unfair-puzzle shape" (S6-091) — the mechanism that makes injection precise risks an illegible lottery (the #1 cross-concept risk, S1-056). The physics rules also make good scenes un-writable (S6-170), and the best sentences kept landing in *discarded* over-length drafts (S6-060/S2-035).

- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-43 + B T-48
  - basis: Both assert the required self-evaluation slot and that AI writers used it to confess rather than paper over. A adds the independent-inspector result that showed self-evaluation insufficient.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: Every creative artifact was required to end by grading itself against the spec, and the AI writers used the slot to confess non-compliance rather than paper over it ('숫자가 1.5개') — but the one time an independent AI inspector was run against a self-passed draft it found 18 issues, 7 of them mechanically detectable.

  - *[from A T-43]* **S2-057 is decisive** — 우는다리 shipped with its §9 self-check, and a two-pass paper check (orchestrator read, then a dedicated inspector subagent) turned up **18** issues; the finding-adjudication split (7 fixed / 6 rejected on a contract argument / 3 deferred to the probe's jurisdiction) shows even the inspector's yield needed a second authority. **S2-058** compounds it: 7 of those 18 were mechanically detectable, i.e. within reach of a lint the self-check never approximated. A2 searched for a case where a self-evaluation caught something a later pass missed and found none.
  - *[from B T-48]* Self-audit is model self-report, which the corpus repeatedly shows cannot certify itself — S2-062 (`refs` honest "merely because the prompt asks"), S3-005 (model fabricates block ids in its own traceability field), S2-009 (the forger reproduced the audit conventions + a false `tool_uses: 0`). The confessions are trusted only because a human re-reads.

### T-44 — Paper tests: the riskiest assumption hand-played before any code existed

- provenance: **A-only** — sources: A T-44
  - basis: B T-50's loop includes a paper-check step, but no B theme asserts the paper test as a de-risking method — hand-playing the riskiest architectural bet before any code exists.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: The most dangerous architectural bet — that an LLM judge can *feel* fair — was made falsifiable in a 30–60 minute hand-played session with no code, by writing a self-contained brief that turns a fresh LLM session into a test rig. The same move was made for the deduction engine, where a Claude Code session was declared the harness outright.

- counter-evidence:
  - *[from A T-44]* **the cheap method leaks and the corpus prices it.** S2-042: the protocol's own required 1–5 rating was never captured — a hand-played test loses data a coded harness would have recorded. S2-012 lists the losses up front (subagent wall clock as a latency proxy; E2 cut from 5 runs to 3). **S2-013**: the paper test's authored world contained a mathematically *impossible* ending, found by exhaustive computation rather than by playing — the hand-played half would not have caught it. **S2-001**: the harness-is-a-session choice is exactly what made the fabrication possible; a code harness has no temptation to run the experiment for you. And S1-047 warns that paper density passing does not guarantee play density.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-44]* **no atom compares the paper test's verdict against the eventual coded implementation** — nobody checked whether the hand-played prediction held. That check, if run, would be the strongest possible endorsement of the method and is not in the corpus.

- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: A distinct defect class: the invariants, schemas and test suites were built around mechanics, and *content* walked past all of them — a dead card, two identical faces, two fork cards with the same copy, a customer no balance invariant could see, a demo that 'doesn't end, it stops'. **B's addition:** generated content was audited like code, for reachability and dead paths *and* for the taste left in a judge's first 60 seconds.

  - *[from A T-45]* the project's answer was to push content checks into the schema (S7-009, S7-011, S6-135's E5 "a lock with one key is a raffle, not deduction") and those rules do fire — S6-125 caught a `>= 1` roster rule making 7 of 19 beats unrunnable by checking against real authored data. So this is a partly-solved class, and its residue is exactly the part that needs a human's eyes (T-46).
  - *[from B T-54]* These catches are on demos that were *cut*, not the shipped game (S9a-006; DDAY has no demo, S8-031), so it is unproven the same rigor reaches DDAY content; and the reviewers are themselves AI personas — largely AI-judging-AI-content, complicating the "human judges" reading of T-05.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-45]* no atom measures the content-defect rate before vs after the schema obligations landed. `artifacts/` is empty at snapshot, so S7-014's `score_variance` and `near_miss_trace_rate` — the metrics designed to catch "the gate is decoration" — were never computed.

### T-46 — The verdict stayed human — and agents judged feel anyway
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-46 + B T-05
  - basis: Seed 3, and the most broadly corroborated theme in either pass — all five of B's agents surfaced it independently, and A reaches the same finding with the same complication. Containment 0.67.
- #4-role: **spine**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): the boundary migrated *toward more human hands-on work* in the manual phase (human plays the live run, files first-minute requests); reinforce the “timestamp, don't state as constant” note.
- **OH-5 update (2026-08-07, oral — does not become written):** supplies the practice-side data point this theme's `gaps` said was missing. A human ran the Doodle Life demo to the end and killed the track on a fun verdict — "너무 재미없고 게임성이 없다" — *against* a live counter-argument that a better model or prompt would fix it. So the fun verdict did land on a human, in play, and overrode a technical rebuttal. The `gaps` line "no human playtest verdict exists in any slice" is now oral-answered for the demo phase and **still open for DDAY itself**. Seed 3's rule side is strengthened; the porousness recorded in counter-evidence stands unchanged.
- thesis: Seed 3 is **supported as a governance rule and contradicted as a description of practice.** Across every slice the final verdict — is the mechanism real, is the scenario good, is this worth keeping — is explicitly reserved for a named person; and across the same slices agent review seats routinely made accepted fun-adjacent judgments, one of them rewriting NPC dialogue on taste grounds. **B's addition:** the boundary also *migrated* under deadline (blind coding dropped, the V3/E5′ verdict skipped), so it must be timestamped, not stated as a constant.

And the humans did not always exercise the reserved faculty: S6-063 (two scheduled human quality verdicts skipped), S9a-W011 (a bare "LGTM"), S4-019 (the two humans never agreed that fun is even the optimization target — status "가중치 합의 없음"), S4-012 (on the one live fun question they reached no conclusion).
  - *[from B T-05]* The boundary is **porous and it migrated.** (a) The team *did* push measurement into fun-adjacent territory — policy-gap "추리가 값을 하는가" is an instrument for "is this fun-shaped" (S6-145, S7-014), and game-feel became a *scored review lens* with an evidence bar (S5-005, catches at S6-190). (b) An LLM *does* judge inside the game — the kept LLM-judge, called "이 아키텍처의 존재 증명" (S2-039/S1-023/S3-036). (c) Under deadline the human verdict was *skipped or traded*, not exercised: blind coding dropped (S3-023/S3-056), V3/E5′ fun/quality evals "accepted into concept confirmation" without a separate verdict (S6-063). So the seed holds as a *rule* more cleanly than as a *practice*.
- gaps:

The demo bake-off's evaluation reasoning is absent from every written source. Whether agents *could* have originated fun criteria is unprovable because they were never asked to.
  - *[from B T-05]* The corpus never shows a human judging DDAY's fun *in play* — every fun verdict is on paper tests or demos; the deferred V3/E5′ verdict is never delivered; human-verdict reproducibility between the two members is unmeasured.

- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.

  - basis: A states the general rule ('work whose failure mode is silent'); B independently derives the single sharpest instance — the live/vendor path agents can never verify — with the same reasoning.
- #4-role: **section**
- thesis: The corpus contains an explicit, reasoned list of jobs the humans refused to delegate — running a paid generator, authoring prompts with methodological stakes, judging a mechanism run, compiling the datapack, creating infrastructure for the first time, overriding a pre-registered rule — and each refusal is argued from the AI's *failure mode*, not from distrust in general. **B's addition:** the sharpest case is the vendor call itself — pipeline agents hold no API keys and vendor output is non-deterministic, so anything touching the LLM call is declared unverifiable-by-agent, provided pre-built and frozen, and its real correctness made a human live-smoke step. 'The biggest risk we removed was a unit whose author could never execute its own code.'

S5-W007 / S5-013 — by 08-03 the frontend-mod v2 hands agents their own build screenshot and the reference PNG and asks them to judge divergence in-loop, a perception task previously reserved for humans. S9b-012 — a human-provided path did not exist, so an agent built it in-run under approval. S9b-174, S9b-167 / S9b-W013 — scenario writing, the most creative task in the project, was delegated to a bounded loop. S4-052 shows the reverse trust direction too: the agent is trusted to *degrade honestly* rather than being fenced out. And S5-008 states the split as a rule with **no atom measuring compliance with it**.
  - *[from B T-24]* The fence is not absolute — S9b-012 (when the "provided" vendor path didn't exist on the branch, the human ratified an in-run scope expansion), S9b-113/S5-028 (the agent-arena backend *was* live-verified across both providers and MCP/Skills — with keys, run by/for a human). So the boundary is "agents can't self-verify live," not "agents never touch live."

The demanding-evidence pattern is not uniform: S9a-W011's bare "LGTM"; and S9a-092 / S9a-W009 / S9a-W010 show whole late runs merging with no human comment at all. **The clean claim "humans judge, AI measures" survives as a division of *labour*, not of *reliability*.**

### T-49 — Two humans reviewing each other: the manual-PR adversarial channel
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **A-only** — sources: A T-49
  - basis: Confirmed A-only by the id test. The two-humans-review-each-other channel appears in no B theme — B's lanes are about what AI is used for, and this is a human-to-human channel.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: In the non-harness PRs the division of labour is explicit and consistent — the *bodies* are agent-drafted (structured What/Why/Verification/Not-in-scope, '🤖 Generated with Claude Code'), while the human hand appears in the reversals, the 'a human must decide this' flags and the rebuttals. Two humans review each other hard, and approvals are withdrawn when the premise changes.

### T-50 — Dissent kept as a first-class column, and open questions closed by nobody
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-50
  - basis: B T-38 independently asserts the minutes' disagreements-table structure and its living-amended-ledger character, so the artifact claim is corroborated; A's finding that the founding disagreement is *absent from* that table is A's.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- **OH-5 update (2026-08-07, oral):** a second, independent instance of the pattern. The **VLM 판정 편차** debate never closed — 윤석 held it is "LLM의 성질이고 해석의 재미로 쓸 수 있다", 민서 held "플레이어에겐 랜덤 판정으로 보인다" — and other reasons folded the track before the argument finished. An open question closed by nobody, and the second two-directors disagreement on record after the membrane settlement (T-70).
- thesis: The meeting machinery preserves disagreement structurally — a disagreements table, an open-questions list, per-attendee positions — and several of the project's central questions are recorded as *unresolved* rather than settled, including questions later decisions quietly answered without ever closing them. **The disagreements table exists and the project's founding disagreement is not in it.**

S5-024 makes the opposite move, pre-resolving scorer disagreement by a fixed rule.

### T-51 — Latency as a design input — measured late, sidestepped by diegetic waiting, and never decided on speed alone
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-51 + B T-13
  - basis: Seed 2. Containment 0.71. Both passes reach the same qualified verdict; A's is the sharper one and governs the merged record (see the seed table).
- #4-role: **section**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): this sweep is the **first real-deploy latency measurement** the theme flagged as untested (S12-024..027); partly closes T-51's own gap, but the Bedrock re-measurement gap (T-73/T-86) stays open.
- thesis: Response time entered the record as a *game* constraint before any concept was chosen and every subsequent architecture decision is priced against it. But the shipping budget was an untested copy from another game until the first real deploy on 2026-08-04, and the one model decision that turned on measurement was decided on contract compliance and measurement continuity rather than on latency. **B's addition:** the *speed itself* was largely never achieved — it was sidestepped by making waiting diegetic, codified as 'latency hides in natural pauses; never block mid-action gameplay'.

- counter-evidence:
  - *[from A T-51]* **the latency budget was inherited, not derived.** S9b-185 / S8-060: the reporter's 7 s ceiling "came from apothecary's … The arithmetic was fine; the premise — that 7 s covers a call this tier had never made — was never tested"; the one call that passed under it "did not beat the clock by being fast, it beat it by breaking the contract" (16 sentences against a required 20–30). **The rigorous model-selection benchmark was dropped twice** (S4-072, S5-023), and the shipped model was chosen "on live verification of access and schema behavior, not on the model-selection benchmark the earlier plan required". **S6-022 decides model choice on measurement continuity, not speed**: Nova 2 Lite benchmarked at 4.19 s vs haiku 7.79 s on a byte-identical prompt and **rejected**, because the gap "is almost entirely that it writes **less**" and switching "would decouple the measured mechanism from the shipped system six days before the deadline." S6-080 / S6-076 show the team unable to state a latency budget for weeks and disqualifying its own figures. S4-009 left the budget unquantified as open question #7. **And the freedom levers make every call slower** (S2-069: 29.7 → 52.9 s), so T-02 and T-51 pull against each other with no atom resolving the trade.
  - *[from B T-13]* The speed mostly did NOT materialize as measured responsiveness — ~19–75s figures withdrawn as measuring subagent round-trips not API calls (S3-004/S6-080), the first real reporter call blew its budget 2/3 and the "passing" one "beat the clock by breaking the contract" (S6-020/S8-060/S9b-185), SSE streaming was never built (typewriter is a client-side replay, S6-081). The "must appear early and visibly" requirement is asserted in guides (S6-170) but never measured against actual player perception. So the seed reads best as *illusion of pace via fiction and fallback*, not achieved speed — it lives in lane 1 with cost (T-11) as its real cross-tie; the pacing-as-freedom causal claim is under-evidenced.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-51]* **the seed's actual claim — that pacing *serves the illusion of freedom* — attaches to nothing in 905 atoms.** Every latency atom links speed to build cost, judge attention, contract compliance or measurement budget; A1, A2, A3, A5, A6, A7 and A8 each looked for the causal link independently and none found it. **No atom reports a human judging that the game felt fast or slow** — the chain stops at seconds measured and never reaches perceived pace. No end-to-end production latency distribution exists.
  - *[from B T-13]* No end-to-end player-felt latency measurement existed at snapshot (proxy went live 08-04 with only smoke numbers, S6-017) — the seed's payoff is unmeasured.

The only tens-to-hundreds program is the *mechanism* probe, which holds the model **fixed** ("모든 테스트는 haiku", S8-036) and varies the stance set — the opposite variable. **The two programs appear conflated in memory, and A3 independently warns that reading S3-039's "381 attempts" as 윤석's sweep would be wrong.** *No trace*: "일주일은 걸렸을 일을 반나절 만에 결정했다" — nothing in any slice records elapsed time for any measurement program. *No trace*: "지연성을 게임의 일부분으로 자연스럽게 풀어낼 수 있을까" — S8-051's typewriter transport is the nearest written thing and its stated reason is transport choice, not latency-as-aesthetic. **Do not launder any of this.**

### T-52 — Every model call has a deterministic understudy: the game is designed to survive the AI's absence
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **A-only** — sources: A T-52
  - basis: B mentions deterministic fallbacks inside B T-13 (pacing) and B T-20 (proxy shape), but always in service of another thesis. The claim that the AI is architected to be *droppable* — that 'no AI' is a designed state rather than an error state — is A's, and A explicitly marks it as distinct from speed.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: Distinct from speed — the AI is architected to be *droppable*. Fallbacks are pre-authored and playable, the deployed build physically lacks the live path, and fallback is signalled honestly rather than disguised, so 'no AI' is a designed state of the game rather than an error state.

S6-063 shows schedule pressure winning over verification, the same axis pointing the other way. S6-013 leaves a judge-visible surface (the README) stale.

S3-039 shows the program running to ≈555 of a 600-call hard stop, i.e. the cheap-kill culture did not actually reduce total spend. And S3-004's own premise was a measurement error: the budget was sized on a latency figure wrong by ~6×.
  - *[from B T-11]* Cost sometimes *lost* on purpose — haiku kept over the cheaper Nova to preserve measurement continuity (S6-022/S9b-186); a public unauthenticated endpoint with "no absolute monthly cost ceiling" accepted (S5-025, S9b-188).

### T-55 — Exploration got cheap enough to be disposable — until the spec-first decree stopped it
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-55 + B T-35

- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: Between 07-23 and 07-26 the default epistemics were 'build it and look': three demos, a fully live-verified backend and a deployable Lambda tier were produced and written off within days each, sometimes in the same commit. On 07-30 that default was explicitly banned. AI throughput made building cheap enough to be a *decision instrument*, and the correction was a process rule. **B's reading of the same window, kept alongside:** this is raw autonomous throughput as a capability — parallel-agent runs merged green deployable shells from a one-page PRD, and a fourth AI concept was built, benchmarked against Bedrock, and archived in a single commit.

  - *[from A T-55]* the prudence the theme says they lacked is also on the record — S4-047 (the team explicitly refused to stack two unknowns on a critical path), S5-010's dry-run discipline, S4-045 (deliberate scope-fencing, later overturned by S4-061, but a considered position). The cost was not zero and the corpus says so: S8-038 (30 calls on a mis-specified gate), S8-061 (grants like `apigateway:TagResource` "cost a failed deploy to find"), S8-024 (the harness lost committed work twice in one run). **S8-009 shows disposability shading into churn** — the ascension gamble cut, restored ("운은 이 장르의 재미이고 … '돌릴까 말까'의 도박은 자원 관리보다 오래 기억된다") and cut again inside 48 hours, "each flip carrying its stated reason … the tension is that the reasons contradict." And S8-061's benchmark "dropped without a record" shows cheap exploration also producing cheap loss. The "cheap to build" reading is an inference from the discard rate; no atom states it.
  - *[from B T-35]* Throughput repeatedly produced *discarded* output — S4-035/S8-022 (a verified 146-test backend shelved undeployed a day later), S9a-006/S9a-078 (working demos closed unmerged by a pivot). Speed, not durable output. The one-pass green e-units also cut against T-22 trust-inversion (merged with no reviewer re-run).

### T-56 — What the method cost, in the units the record actually kept
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **A-only** — sources: A T-56
  - basis: B folds all cost into one theme (B T-11, merged at T-54). The four-currency decomposition and the finding that it has no totals is A's.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: The corpus prices the method in four currencies — wall clock, usage limits, failed attempts and API spend — and in each case the number sits next to the decision it drove. It is the only quantitative account of the harness's economics, and it has no totals.

- gaps:
  - *[from A T-56]* a cost sweep needs the harness repo's run logs (off-corpus, sibling repo) and the API billing (off-repo).

### T-57 — The concept phase was built as a comparison funnel, and the winner came from outside it
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-57 + B T-46
  - basis: Containment 0.62. Both passes reach the same three-part shape: comparison machinery built, then deliberately retired, then the winner arriving from outside it.
- #4-role: **section**
- **OH-5 update (2026-08-07):** the funnel's ending is now documented, and it is not a selection. **약국 was positively evaluated on 07-27** (it, not darkest, conveyed 효용감 that the LLM was really performing work) and was displaced because DDAY planning was going better and was more fun. **darkest was not eliminated by a verdict**: the 07-27 disposition was 전면 수정 후 재드래프트, and it died on 07-28 when nobody prepared the revision. The 07-27 meeting produced **three** candidates (① 신작 텍스트 추리 ② darkest 변경안 ③ 약국); ② was never prepared and ① was duplicated at a different scale, collapsing the comparison to two. **The apparatus this theme describes did not make the final call — attrition did.** `gaps` status: the 07-27 review content is **located, unmined** (PR #85 / #91, `planning/dday-sot.md`), not absent.
- thesis: Selection machinery came first — a template whose stated purpose was side-by-side comparability, mandatory verification-gap confessions, honesty rules to stop well-written unverified docs winning, a cap on differentiators used as a maturity test — and it merged eight concepts into three tracks, then declared documents insufficient and handed the verdict to playable demos ('fun is judged by playable demos, not writable docs'). The concept that won followed none of it.

S4-021 records the confirmation with **no minutes for the discussion that produced it**. The funnel's own input count does not reconcile: S1 holds eight concept docs, S4-001 and S8-010 say six proposals. And S4-019 shows the two humans did not agree on what the bake-off was optimizing for.
  - *[from B T-46]* The abandonment is the built-in contradiction, confirmed cross-slice (S1-029/S6-047 retires the machinery S1-001/S8-007 built). The losing demos stayed *deployed* as selection evidence (S6-035). The curated funnel did *not* produce the final game — a failure-born new concept did (S4-021, S8-030).

  - *[from B T-46]* The corpus can't quantify how much the template-comparison influenced the final pick vs. the bake-off; the winner's selection reasoning is a documented record-gap (S4-021). **This is the S8 "Doodle Life cut pre-build" defect zone — use the corrected three-demos sequence.**

  - *[from A T-57]* OH-1 §6's process shape (many concepts → merge to 3 → 3 demos → comparison → *new* concept discussion → confirmation) is corroborated link by link but **not** in its causal ordering.

### T-58 — Three demos built, none won, a fourth concept won — and the reasons are almost entirely oral
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-58
  - basis: B T-46 independently asserts that the winner was a post-demo new concept the funnel never contained, so the outcome is corroborated; A's framing of the *reasons* as almost entirely oral is A's.
- #4-role: **section**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): narrow “almost entirely oral” — the 07-27 written note (S4-075..079) now carries much of the pivot reasoning.
- **OH-5 update (2026-08-07):** the reasons are no longer "almost entirely oral", and the outcome framing is corrected. Per-track dispositions, oral: **Doodle Life** cut 07-24 by a human play verdict *before* the other two were built — contributing reasons latency (1–2 min or failure; ~20 s for the VLM alone, against "10초도 길다"), verdict variance on identical input, and abstract translated-register NPC dialogue — with the human verdict decisive over a rebuttal that a better model would fix it, on cost-of-repair grounds. **약국** displaced, not beaten (see T-57). **darkest** lost its defence, not a verdict. The four-branch darkest critique — 인지 부조화 · 관전형 구조의 지루함 · UI/UX 정체성 결여 · 기술의 단순 소모, with 어거지 매핑 and DD-아류 named as two horns of one dilemma — replaces this theme's single-resemblance reading. **"Three demos built → none won → a fourth won" should be retired in #4** in favour of: one killed by play, one killed by a process accident, one displaced by enthusiasm. The pivot has **no single author** — seed by 윤석 (단일 task 에이전트), grown to its current form by 민서 (재난 상황 루프) — and the pivot moment is the 07-27 frame shift to 재난 시뮬레이션 + 인간 퍼즐 + 갭 분석 루프, *not* the "단일 task" phrase. OH-2's "retained core" and "problems dissolved" claims are **confirmed as present in a written artifact** (concept doc §1 and the §3 table), pending the sweep.
- thesis: The team deferred the concept decision to *played* demos, ran the comparison, killed everything in it, and confirmed a concept that had never been in the bake-off — drafted as a replacement for the thing a demo proved didn't work. The written record carries the outcome and almost none of the reasoning. **Corrected demo set (carried from the Phase 3 brief, superseding OH-4 and both maps): apothecary + darkest-context (merged) + doodle-life (closed PR #16, `demos/doodle-life/` + `artifacts/doodle-life-evals/`, closed 2026-07-25, never deployed to `main`) → none won → DDAY.**

  - *[from A T-58]* **the known-wrong input lives here and is preserved, not overwritten.** S8's own OH-1-corroboration prose concludes "the count is two", "Doodle Life … no build commit and no `demos/` directory ever", "Doodle Life cut pre-build." OH-4 resolves this against the repo: Doodle Life *was* built into a demo, was never deployed, and survives only as screenshots. Both are left standing. **A residual gap remains inside the written record**: S4's own corroboration section states that at 07-24 only Doodle Life had a playable demo, apothecary was still generating, and Agent Arena had **none** — and no S4 atom records an Agent Arena demo ever existing. So the written slices now evidence Doodle Life (correcting S8) and apothecary and darkest-context, but the reconciliation of *which* three is not clean. **Preserve both counts; do not average them.**
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-58]* **the reasons the demos lost are almost absent.** Only S8-019 (apothecary v1 demoed the shell, not the AI) and S8-030 (darkest-context's 어거지 매핑) appear; nothing on Doodle Life's verdict or on apothecary v2. The Doodle Life screenshots are **off-repo** and, per OH-4, would need `assets-manifest.json` entries to enter. A pros/cons write-up of the three unpicked concepts (OH-2's inclusion question (a)) does not exist and needs an interview.
- oral-only:
  - *[from A T-58]* **the causal content of the pivot is the single most important undocumented decision in the project.** OH-2 §5: 약국 worked but its calm genre felt less fun; 다키스트 컨택스트 was fun with potential but too close to Darkest Dungeon, forcing a change; the move was to keep its *verified* core (grow-agent-by-prompt-injection + spectate), whose open problems *dissolved* once reframed as "build an agent that solves a single task", then drop the team's weak spots (graphics/animation) → a text deduction game. **None of this reasoning appears in any slice.** A4, A6, A7 and A8 each checked independently. S8-030 confirms DDAY's *origin* in a demo failure but not the reframe.

### T-59 — Inherited numbers carry inherited assumptions — and the deploy/CI machinery was the unguarded organ
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-59 + B T-37
  - basis: A names the copy-forward failure class; B names the same events as the unguarded deploy/CI organ. B's unification is B's, but every component fact — the CI gate wired to nothing, the parity gate that ran when someone remembered, inherited IAM/latency assumptions breaking on first real traffic — is asserted in A (T-26, T-59, T-10).
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: DDAY was built by salvaging the previous build cycle — a Lambda copied, a bootstrap stack reused, a runbook's constants adopted — and the clearest causal chain in the corpus is that each inherited artefact carried the lifecycle it was authored for and broke exactly where the new use differed. The team eventually named the class. **B's addition:** the pipeline that guards correctness was itself long ungated — no PR in the repo had ever run CI, the proxy's parity gate ran 'only when someone remembered', a dev middleware allowed arbitrary repo-file reads. Deployability was proven day one; the guards around it were retrofitted mid-competition.

  - *[from A T-59]* **salvage also worked, repeatedly** — S6-099 (the copy strategy kept the live demo safe), S6-043 (an archived implementation earning its merge), S6-018 (the bucket and OIDC reuse "was correct"), S6-044 (plumbing built ahead of the concept decision on the grounds that it is concept-agnostic — a bet that paid), S5-W013 (the archived thin Lambda→Bedrock shape named as the DDAY runtime template), S8-022 (a *deliberate* non-copy-forward with next-work items explicitly voided). **S6-092 is the strongest counter**: the team's prior written position that relocating the harness "buys nothing and costs provenance" turned out to be wrong on both halves — the conservatism about moving inherited things was itself the error. And S7 has no atoms here at all: the data layer was authored fresh for DDAY and is untouched by this class.
  - *[from B T-37]* Not everything infra-side was unguarded — S8-W008/S6-027 (parity gate mutation-tested, 8/9 renderer mutations red), S8-W012 (deploy role scoped with `iam:simulate-principal-policy` before first use), S9a-072 (agent refused to grant itself `iam:PutRolePolicy`). Strong local guards existed even while the *wiring* into CI was missing.

  - *[from A T-59]* no atom enumerates what else was inherited from the demos and never re-validated; a sweep of the post-snapshot commits for "inherited"/"apothecary" reasoning would size the class. No cost accounting for salvage overall (S6 records the three IAM rounds, not the hours).
  - *[from B T-37]* First live proxy deploy and CI-over-OIDC (#138/#139) are at the snapshot edge; S9b-191 says the IAM→Bedrock path "is still unproven; this merge is what first exercises it."

- thesis: The project systematically preserves superseded positions, dead channels, losing arguments and its own blemishes, and pays real usability costs to do so — raw artifacts never edited, failed configurations never deleted, corrections appended rather than applied, decisions stored *inside* the thing decided. **B's addition — the over-determination:** two independent forces point the same way. LLM output is non-reproducible, so a deleted record cannot be regenerated; and the process trail is itself a graded deliverable.

S6-069 and S6-146 show the cost: a reader must check a header or a warning box to know whether the body is true. **S6-030 is a genuine counter-case inside the game design** — a removed block is discarded, not shelved, and there is no discard inventory; the preserve-everything instinct was explicitly refused where it would cost UX. **S8-009** shows a record that annotates every reversal does not thereby become consistent ("the reasons contradict"); S8-061 records a benchmark "dropped without a record"; S8-031 records an AGENTS.md drifted to "`.Codex/super/` 오기"; S9b-130 shows an entire merged PR silently absent from `main` for a day. And **S4-021** is the sharpest: the single most important pivot of the project left no record at all — *the convention is strongest exactly where the stakes are lowest.*
  - *[from A T-39]* **immutability is not completeness**, and the corpus contains the hole: S3-046's harness-created bias "had gone unreported through seven write-ups" — an append-only log cannot evidence what was never appended. S3-038 shows a permanent-looking infrastructure change made mid-run. **S2-035 is the sharpest**: the pipeline's own sentence-count retry rule was silently discarding the best material until a later scoring pass noticed — and S2-024 says "위반이 곧 데이터다" was a *v2* change, so v1 *was* laundering format failures. How many v1 retries silently overwrote a violation is unknowable; v1 didn't count them.
  - *[from B T-07]* Preservation is not absolute — the model-selection benchmark was *deliberately dropped* (S5-023/S4-072); leaked tool-call XML survived unreviewed ~10 days across two moves (S5-011); an entire merged PR's content silently dropped from main until cherry-picked back (S9b-130); a README stale self-contradiction sat unannotated at snapshot (S6-013).

- thesis: Because *how the team orchestrates AI* is graded, the repo's rules were written to make the evidence a by-product of normal work — manifest entries at asset-creation time, raw call logging in the runtime, personal-account attribution, immutable history, a PR template feeding the deliverables — and one section of deliverable #4 was in fact auto-drafted by the harness from run telemetry, TODOs and the board. **B's framing, carried:** this is one face of a reflexive layer — agents mutation-testing other agents' guards, an AI running probes on other LLMs under rules that treat the referee as a contamination risk, a known-fake negative control validating the pipeline before its results are read. B argues this layer is arguably the *centre* of deliverable #4.

  - *[from A T-61]* **the self-drafting deliverable did not happen as designed** — S5-007's own atom notes "This mining directory is the successor to that draft — mining README Phase 5 subsumes it." That is a reversal at the heart of the theme and must not be smoothed over: *the mining effort producing these very atoms exists because the auto-draft could not cover the whole.* The evidence chain has recorded holes: S6-188 (six substantive reviews exist only in local run state while the PRs show zero threads — flagged by the drafting agent itself as a claim the deliverable must not overstate), S6-184 (unknown total tokens, an unrecorded skip reason, absent open-source license attribution), S6-197 (1 of 6 screenshot attempts skipped with the reason unrecorded), S6-194, S6-198 (one run of several covered). S4-016 also concedes the strongest evidence — the harness source — cannot be shown at all.
  - *[from B T-10]* The self-authored draft has integrity holes it must confess — S6-188 (six reviews exist only on disk, not in the PR trail the deliverable wants to cite), S6-194 (a missing trailer kept), S6-198 (draft covers one run of 3+). The orchestration *tool* (super-pipeline) is deliberately kept in a separate repo, out of the deliverable (S6-010), so one could argue the method-tool is not a repo lane. A human polish and this very mining phase exist *because* the auto-draft can't close its own gaps.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-61]* **no atom says why the auto-draft was abandoned**, and the draft artifact itself, if generated, is not in S4/S5. S6 has no atom for the v1 shell run, the concurrent darkest-context run, or any manual Claude Code session (S6-198 names all three as uncovered).
  - *[from B T-10]* The auto-draft covers only the apothecary v1 run; the darkest-context run, the DDAY engine build (#116), and the mechanism program have no equivalent capture — and the largest runs postdate the snapshot.

### T-62 — Provenance recorded as data — legible and leaky
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-62 + B T-08
  - basis: Both assert the same double finding: provenance is machine-readable *and* it leaked. B frames it as governance (intent held, letter drifted); A frames it as a data artifact.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: Because AI contributions were trailered per commit, ownership stamped into artifacts and assets manifested at creation, the repo accidentally contains a machine-readable record of which model did which kind of work — and, in the same record, four identity leaks the project's own hard rules exist to prevent. **B's framing:** the hard rule's *intent* held perfectly (no corporate identifier anywhere) while its *letter* drifted across machine/config boundaries, and agents surfaced the ambiguity rather than hiding it.

- counter-evidence:
  - *[from A T-62]* **every count is over a truncated 153-commit prefix** — S8-058's "exactly these two commits", S8-023's "the lone machine-local trailer", S8-011's "only 2", S8-056's per-model totals and S8-002's "33 of 153" could all move with the 117 unmined commits. S8-057 shows the hard identity rule satisfied in *intent* (personal, never corporate) while drifting from its letter, so "legible provenance" and "rule-compliant provenance" are not the same finding. **S3-064 carries the multi-vendor claim single-handed**, from one line in one file header with an uncertain date (`2026-07-29?`), and nothing shows 윤석 exercising the rejection right the ownership protocol reserves for him.
  - *[from B T-08]* The rule's *core* is uncontested — no corporate-domain address appears anywhere; the drift is in the letter, not the purpose. A theme claiming "the rule failed" would be wrong.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-62]* trailers record *which model was invoked*, not how much of the diff it wrote or whether a human rewrote it — S8-056's division-of-labour reading is an inference from commit subject matter, not a measurement, and nothing in the corpus can size it. **A repo-wide grep for `Codex` and other tool names in `planning/` and commit trailers would settle whether the workflow was single-vendor — and if #4 claims it was, S3-064 contradicts it.** That check belongs to the pre-Phase-3 sweep.
  - *[from B T-08]* The corpus cannot affirmatively prove no corporate machine was ever an author — by construction that trace is absent (which is the rule working).

### T-63 — A repo-mined history is blind exactly where the biggest decisions were made
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: A T-63 + B T-12
  - basis: Both passes independently call this a method-finding against their own method. Containment 0.80.
- #4-role: **section**
- **OH-5 update (2026-08-07) — this theme just predicted itself again.** The DDAY-selection `record-gap` (S4-021) is **a mining miss, not an absence**: `planning/concepts/game-concept-dday-simulation.md` (PR #85), `planning/dday-sot.md` and `planning/dday-design-doc.md` (PR #91) exist in-repo, and the reason mining missed the first is that **the slug is `dday-simulation`, not `dday`**. That is failure mode (b) — "work that moved or was renamed out of where the miner looked" — caught by the oral channel, exactly as this theme says only interviews can. Second confirmed instance after OH-4's. Also sharpened: closing PR #16 unmerged was **deliberate preservation policy**, so the under-counting of closed PRs is *systematic wherever that policy applied*, not incidental. **The theme is strengthened; the corpus is what was wrong.**
- thesis: The mining that produced these atoms demonstrates, against itself, that a self-audit conducted through a git repository cannot see (a) work whose artifact was never committed, (b) work that moved or was renamed out of where the miner looked, and (c) anything past the snapshot. All three are visible inside the corpus, and one produced a **false finding that reached an atom file**. **Sharpened by the Phase 3 brief:** the Doodle Life case is not 'uncommitted work' but a *closed PR* — a fully built demo living in closed PR #16 that never reached `main`. Repo-mining that reads only `main` plus merged history under-counts closed PRs, which is a narrower and more actionable failure mode than the one either pass recorded.

S4-032 / S4-W002 argue the opposite locally (the 07-30 minutes actively maintained with cross-references, closing 8 of 9 tracked items), and S4-016 is a deliberate bet that the repo *is* a sufficient record.
  - *[from B T-12]* The repo is not blind to its own gaps — the AI-utilization draft enumerates what it doesn't cover (S6-198); status/handoff atoms flag record-gaps (S4-021's own flag). The finding is that it can only flag gaps it *noticed*.
- gaps:
  - *[from A T-63]* **nobody has enumerated what else the repo cannot see.** The Doodle Life screenshots are the one named off-repo artifact (OH-4); there may be others — the S8-032 benchmark raw data, a whiteboard, chat logs, the S4-008 recording. Only interviews find these. The pre-Phase-3 sweep closes (c) and neither (a) nor (b).
  - *[from B T-12]* By definition the corpus cannot bound how much *unnoticed* unlanded work exists — that ceiling is only reachable via OH. **New corpus target: the Doodle Life screenshots (off-repo); if they enter the repo they need `assets-manifest.json` entries (hard rule 5).**
- oral-only:
  - *[from A T-63]* the Doodle Life build and its screenshots rest on **OH-4 alone**; no S7/S8 atom evidences the build and S8's own text says the opposite. OH-4's generalization — "any team auditing itself through its own repo will systematically under-count work that never landed" — is the framing; the corpus supplies at least six independent written instances of the *pattern*, so the pattern is written even though its flagship case is oral.
  - *[from B T-12]* the demo-count correction rests on OH-4; the DDAY-discussion existence on OH-1 + the 07-24/07-28 inference.

- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: The team repeatedly drew the trust boundary at the exact edge of what it had measured — a capability that passed a test was given to the AI, an adjacent untested one was withheld and hand-authored instead — and matured this into a general practice of declining to build, deciding in advance how a bet will be killed, and constraining its own future repair options.

### T-68 — Should the machinery show? Two opposite answers, both kept
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.

  - basis: A chronology-shaped find (two opposite positions within one week) that B's lane sweep had no vantage point for.
- #4-role: **section**  *(promoted from `archive` by OH-5 — see the OH-5 note below)*
- **OH-5 update (2026-08-07, oral) — this is why the role moved.** The question stops being two opinions and acquires an empirical answer. darkest-context's 07-27 critique found **인지 부조화**: bolting 프롬프트·MCP·스킬 onto a fantasy worldview left the machinery with no 당위성, and the dilemma is two-horned — keep the mapping and it reads 이질감, remove it and the game reads as a Darkest Dungeon 아류. DDAY's naked-agent-vocabulary answer is the resolution of a *diagnosed* failure, not a taste reversal. That gives this theme a causal chain into the winning concept and lifts it out of concept-doc-only THIN territory — hence `archive` → `section`. The THIN mark is retained: the evidence base is still one slice plus oral, pending the sweep.

Note also **S5-033** ("성격이면 Prompt, 익힌 기술이면 Skill, 손에 쥔 물건이면 MCP" proposed *as* the item system) — the mapping DDAY discarded was a considered design bet elsewhere in the corpus, which makes the reversal a real disagreement rather than a correction.

### T-71 — The distrust-spine: selective trust-inversion as the project's single cross-lane stance
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **B-only** — sources: B T-04
  - basis: **Thesis test.** A has all the pieces — T-09 (reviewers re-run self-reports), T-03 (the LLM barred from owning truth), T-41 (a deterministic compiler chosen over an LLM), T-32 (measurement outranks the plan) — but nowhere asserts that these are *one stance recurring identically in every lane*. The unification is exactly the capability-shaped pattern per-slice sharding cuts in half, and it is the clearest vindication of the two-pass design in this map. The id test would have called it `both` and been wrong.
- #4-role: **spine**
- thesis: The defining posture is *selective distrust of the model's characteristic failure modes*, recurring identically in every lane — the LLM is barred from owning truth (game), reviewers re-run every self-reported GREEN (build), measurement outranks the plan (research), a deterministic compiler is chosen over an LLM (creation). The named enemy is always the same set: fabrication, sycophancy, self-attribution error. The distrust is selective, not general: the same model is trusted completely with dialogue, narration and candidate generation.

A theme claiming pure distrust overreaches; the pattern is *calibrated* trust.

### T-72 — Under measurement, over-convergence is as fatal as noise
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **both** — sources: B T-16
  - basis: A T-05 asserts the 24/24 event and calls it a design emergency, so the finding is corroborated; B is the pass that generalised it into a measurement rule (variance tracked per gate rather than pass/fail), and A folds the event into the temperament pivot rather than keeping it as a claim.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- impl-2026-08-10 amendment (proposed): a genuine counter-case, preserved not resolved. In the shipped authored scenario, run-1 determinism is a **design goal**: p=1 target on the fail edge (S2-073), 138 deaths framed as “no run can be worse” (S9c-048). Over-convergence *fear* governs the mechanism/measurement layer while an authored fail-run *wants* determinism. Keep as a live tension.
- thesis: For a game built on model judgment, determinism is as dangerous as variance — an early run set that came back 24/24 identical was a design emergency ('if every player's agent behaves identically, assembly is decoration and the core claim collapses'), so reproducibility is tracked as a measured variable per gate, not as pass/fail.

The parity guard's own enforcement was fragile: no PR in the repo had ever run CI (S8-055, S9a-090), and the byte-parity gate had a blind spot the human's fifth mutation hit (S9a-089/W007).
- gaps:

- thesis: Balance-as-data extends to the AI layer — stances, deltas, symptom sentences, temperament, report-guidance and prompt slots all live in `data/`; the draft→datapack compiler is a zero-LLM deterministic script, because a silent paraphrase would break vocabulary-aligned keys invisibly; balance numbers are stamped by the proxy, never model-chosen.

- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **B-only** — sources: B T-52
  - basis: **Thesis test.** No A theme asserts the inversion — that in a pipeline of machine-generated artifacts, the strictest validation is aimed at the single human-authored file, because only the human can produce a typo.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: In a pack otherwise compiler-generated and therefore deterministic, the single hand-written overlay is given the strictest walls — because everything machine-made cannot carry a typo, and only the human contributor can.
- lanes: 4
- origin: emergent
- seen-by (Pass B): B4 — **[single-source]**
- **THIN:** B T-52 is [single-source] within Pass B.

  S5-011, S6-133, S7-005, S7-006, S9b-169, S9b-170
- counter-evidence:
  - *[from B T-52]* The armor is a fix born of a caught failure, not a standing virtue — S9b-169 discovered the gap after the fact; and human-authored AI-lane artifacts do leak uncaught (S5-011, tool-call XML surviving ~10 days).

### T-84 — Authoring for the machine, not the reader: fiction typed as mineable ore, including deliberate poison
- verdict: **kept** — clears the evidence bar; not a duplicate of any other kept theme; not subsumed.
- provenance: **B-only** — sources: B T-53
  - basis: **Thesis test.** A T-42 asserts writing law derived from measured model behaviour (a rulebook *for* writers); no A theme asserts the inversion this theme names — prose authored as *input to the game loop*, including deliberately planted falsehood as a resource.
- #4-role: **supporting-anecdote**
- thesis: In the creator lane the game's prose is written as a resource for the game loop — narrative typed as a 'mining vein', the report prompt engineered to grow next run's ammunition, and writers asked to author productive falsehood: plausible wrong guesses that ruin the next run.
- lanes: 4 (with 1)
- origin: emergent
- seen-by (Pass B): B4 (+ B1's T-19 two-record cross) — **⇈**
- support (7 atom ids across 5 slices, A ∪ B):
  S1-035, S2-035, S2-046, S5-035, S6-060, S7-002, S7-019, S2-074, S7-022, S7-026 (impl-2026-08-10)
- counter-evidence:
  - *[from B T-53]* Optimizing prose for machine-harvestability shaves quality — S2-035/ S6-060 (the sentence-count retry rule discarded the drafts carrying the strongest temperament expression; "최고의 문장들이 폐기본에 있었다"). Machine-first authoring collides with the human-judged fun goal.
- gaps:
  - *[from B T-53]* Whether players actually read report prose as ore (vs. skimming) is untested.

### T-85 — The phantom-speaker defect family: production hallucinations from prompts authorizing an empty room, cured rule-first
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — overlaps T-07/T-01 but is one coherent incident family they touch only obliquely.
- thesis: The implementation phase's dominant runtime-AI defect was invented or misattributed **speakers** (a 기록관 conjured into an emptied room, NPC lines in the wrong mouth, an agent's own questions handed to an NPC) — each traced to a prompt *permission* that survived a fiction change, not a model weakness. The cure is rule-first (conditional permissions recast as unconditional stage facts, silence made an explicit sentinel, overproduction capped by schema) while explicitly **refusing** a validator for a wrong-but-legal speaker.
- lanes: 1
- origin: emergent
- support: S12-002, S12-006, S12-011, S12-005, S12-014, S12-036, S9c-001, S9c-049; S6-243 (adjacent inner_note echo).
- counter-evidence: S12-005 (schema cap stops only overproduction — a wrong-but-legal speaker stands by design), S12-014 (the cap pushed misattribution sideways into the unconstrained timeline channel). Looked across S12/S9c/S8 for a cure that fully closed the defect; none — every fix opened or left an adjacent hole.
- gaps: whether the rule-first cures hold under a real Bedrock call is unproven (no live narration call at snapshot — S12-015, S12-034); a post-deploy narration smoke would answer.
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section

### T-86 — Making the deployed agent the measured agent — closed for the prompt, still open at the serving path
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — overlaps T-73/T-06 heavily; **fold candidate into a T-73 extension**; kept net-new because the serving-path residual and never-ran-live contradiction are stated by no existing theme.
- thesis: A class of work existed to keep "the gate numbers describe the shipped game" true in production — per-pack default prompts copied verbatim from the probe suite, a byte-identity prompt-parity gate, temperature pinned to 1, pack prose realigned to fixtures. The equivalence is nonetheless incomplete on the record: the probes ran over the Anthropic API while the game calls Bedrock through the proxy (different serving path and tool-call envelope), and at snapshot no real Bedrock call had ever run.
- lanes: 1
- origin: emergent
- support: S8-081, S8-082, S12-020, S12-028, S12-037, S9c-067.
- counter-evidence: S9c-067 (serving-path/envelope gap open), S12-034, S12-038 (no live call at snapshot; config vs README contradiction). Stated by the team, not hidden.
- gaps: only a re-measurement through the deployed tier (unstarted work) can say whether Bedrock's path moves the measured stance distribution.
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section

### T-87 — The two-tier deploy window as a runtime design constraint: sequence the bump, fall back on the unknown, make it un-misconfigurable
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — adjacent to T-51/T-52 but distinct: the deploy-window gap between two independently-shipped tiers.
- thesis: Because the proxy (Bedrock tier) and the client (Pages) deploy on separate triggers, the gap between them is a first-class hazard with a doctrine: prompt versions are append-only and the bump is withheld until the proxy redeploys; an unknown pack slug is served the incumbent agent, not rejected ("wrong in character, right in shape"); timeout ceilings are bounded in config so no env value can break model<route<Lambda ordering.
- lanes: cross (1, 2)
- origin: emergent
- support: S12-010, S12-030, S12-025, S12-023, S9c-005.
- counter-evidence: S8-077 (the hazard was realized once — first live-provider deploy failed its own health probe on the origin guard it had just deployed). No atom contradicts the doctrine itself; looked in S12/S8/S9c.
- gaps: no live player-facing version bump at snapshot; whether fallback-to-incumbent is acceptable to a judge is untested.
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section / possible #2 video beat

### T-88 — From an autonomous fleet to a human-driven single-agent workshop: the method changed shape when the work changed
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **spine (candidate)**> — the frame that re-scopes T-20/T-21/T-22/T-27 as descriptions of *one era*; section at minimum.
- thesis: The AI-orchestration is two eras, not one. The scaffold (engine e0–e10, client u0–u11) was built by the autonomous multi-agent super-pipeline in two overnight runs; the entire implementation/polish/live-wiring phase (#140–#237) ran as human-driven manual PRs + single-agent `claude/*` sessions + surgical single-commit PRDs. Naming the era boundary is what resolves T-27's "maturity vs attrition" — adversarial review didn't die, it moved from agent↔agent unit-PRs to dense human↔agent manual PRs.
- lanes: 2 (with 1, 3)
- origin: emergent
- support: S8-063, S8-064 (the two, and last, fleet runs); S9c-001..048 (#140–#237 = 10 rich human↔agent PRs incl. #234's 11 submissions, + 10 single-agent PRs); S11b-035..044 (surgical single-commit PRDs); S8-111, S9c-029 (human plays the live run); S9c-054..061 (single-agent polish).
- counter-evidence: not a clean break — fleet conventions persist (confession-style bodies, executable PRD S11b-035, parallelism DAG S11b-036); and the corpus never states *why* the fleet stopped for #140+ (see gaps), so "deliberate maturation" is one reading and "forced by deadline / live-wiring being human-gated" is another.
- gaps: the corpus does not record the decision to stop the fleet — deadline? live-provider work unverifiable-by-agent (T-47)? token limits (S8-102)? An interview or a status.md diff could answer.
- oral-only: OH-3 §3 describes the fleet ("유능한 개발팀을 고용") but is silent on the later single-agent phase; the shift is oral-silent, visible only in the PR record.
- fit: #4 section (clearest "evolution of how AI was used") + #2 video beat.

### T-89 — The worktree-sync gap: units built against a ratified spec that existed but was never delivered into their worktree
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**>
- thesis: A recurring super-pipeline provisioning defect — the unit's ratified `spec.md`/`design.md`/contract (the "READ FIRST" artifact) was never copied into the agent's git worktree, so agents built against the prompt JSON + RED tests alone and shipped diverged from already-settled decisions. The fix is always harness-side.
- lanes: 2
- origin: emergent
- support: S11a-004, S11a-008, S11a-013, S11b-012, S11a-005.
- counter-evidence: distinct from a *wrong* spec (S11b-002, S11a-013's scope list) — here the spec was correct; only its delivery failed; and the integration branch caught the divergences (S11a-005), so net safety held. Borders T-26; kept separate as one named mechanism with one class of fix.
- gaps: only units that wrote a discovery note are visible; total incidence and whether the harness was fixed are unmineable (off-repo harness / past snapshot).
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section

### T-90 — Scaffold guards go false the moment the work they guard is done as designed; the pipeline re-aims, never deletes
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**>
- thesis: A census/scaffold/frozen-input guard authored while one unit was alone on the tree becomes a permanent red or a vacuous green once later units land *exactly as designed*. The answer is the C12/C17 discipline: re-aim the assertion at what it now means (or defer it to the integrator), never delete or skip it.
- lanes: 2
- origin: emergent
- support: S11b-003, S11a-033, S11a-050, S11a-042, S11a-048, S11a-049, S9c-034, S9c-035, S8-096, S11b-031.
- counter-evidence: the discipline is not "never red" — some guards are deliberately left failing as noise for the integrator (S11b-003); telling an expired-premise guard from a simply-wrong one is a judgment call (S11a-050). Overlaps T-23/T-24; sharper because it is about a guard's staleness against its own future tree.
- gaps: none material
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section

### T-91 — "There is no wireable shape": work abandoned because two ratified/frozen contracts leave no consistent shape to build against
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — sits between T-47 and T-29; the refusal is a *reasoned architectural stop*, not a capability refusal.
- thesis: A manual-phase stop-condition — an agent finds two already-ratified documents (or a frozen type + a prose contract) disagree so *no* implementation can satisfy both, and stops ("the hole is not 'nobody wired it', it's 'there is no wireable shape'") rather than leave plumbing around an impossible value. Recorded as a contract defect for a human, not a coding failure.
- lanes: 2 (with 3)
- origin: emergent
- support: S9c-032, S11a-012, S11a-038, S11a-034, S9c-042.
- counter-evidence: the same agents instead **mint a reversible shape and flag it** when the conflict is still *open* (S11a-021, S11a-014). The stop is chosen specifically when what collides is frozen/ratified.
- gaps: whether humans then revised the frozen contracts is past-snapshot for several cases.
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section

### T-92 — The implementation-phase g-PRD: a surgical single-commit micro-contract with a hand-authored DAG, a stop-protocol, and the exact-citation discipline that vindicated stopped executors
*(merged from NEW-L2-05 + NEW-L3-02)*
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — manual-era evolution of T-28 and a concrete face of T-88; the executor-boundary + self-vindication pattern is not in T-28.
- thesis: In the manual era the orchestration instrument became the g-PRD — one executor (a "Sonnet-class session"), one branch, exactly one commit with a fixed message, "open a PR, merge nothing," a pre-edit git-identity check, an explicit wave/parallelism declaration keyed on file-disjointness (DAG hand-authored, not harness-inferred), and a boundary clause that treats a documented refusal-to-proceed-on-a-stale-citation as a *completed* run. Change-lists were dry-run-verified on a scratch tree; the exact-citation rule repeatedly caught its own authors' stamping errors.
- lanes: 2, 3
- origin: emergent
- support: S11b-035, S11b-036, S11b-037, S11b-038, S11b-044, S9c-021, S9c-041, S9c-042.
- counter-evidence: the precision was partly aspirational — S9c-018 (~half the plan's ~84 citations carried a defect), S11b-012 (the READ-FIRST contract was absent from many worktrees), S9c-040 (a stacked PR stranded five PRDs on an orphan branch — the plumbing failed), S9c-021 ("zero instances" — the §5 rule set was unproven until executed).
- gaps: only 4 of 30 PRDs read in full; no atom shows a low-cost executor running a g-PRD end-to-end and stopping *in production* (vindications are on scratch trees / in review).
- oral-only: OH-3 §3 ("명세는 기능 단위로 10~20개로 쪼갰다") corroborates the decompose habit but predates and does not describe the single-commit g-PRD form.
- fit: #4 section / #5.

### T-93 — Deliverable #4 was built bottom-up by an AI mining/induction pipeline, engineered to expose its own limits (self-referential) — **THIN, self-excluded**
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **spine (fit) — but blocked THIN**> — cannot carry spine until de-THIN'd. **Needs the pre-#4 pipeline-artifact sweep** to mine the pipeline's own artifacts and lift the single-slice mark.
- thesis: The AI-utilization document was not written from memory — it was constructed by an AI pipeline that mined the repo into 905 atoms across ten slices, ran two blind inductions (Pass A by slice, Pass B by lane), reconciled them into the theme map, and mapped those onto the outline — deliberately built to surface its own weaknesses (coverage gaps logged not dropped, the convergence ranking that demotes the required inventory kept legible, the thesis inverted against "we learned to prompt better").
- lanes: 3 (self-referential; bears on all four)
- origin: emergent
- support: S9c-069, S9c-070, S9c-071, S9c-073. **THIN — all four atoms are single-slice S9c.** The corpus-wide artifact (atoms-S1..S12, this addendum) *is* the pipeline, but the mining effort deliberately excluded its own output (`docs/deliverables/mining/` not mined), so no atom ids exist outside S9c.
- counter-evidence: T-63 + OH-4 + OH-5 — the pipeline was blind exactly where the biggest decision lived (missed the `dday-simulation` slug and the closed-PR demo; a false "cut pre-build" finding reached an atom file), corrected only by the oral channel; S9c-070 (the ranking demotes required content). Self-assembly is real but required human oral correction and produced a known mis-ranking — it did not run clean.
- gaps: no atom-level evidence of the pipeline outside S9c (self-exclusion); whether the two inductions were truly blind is asserted, not checked; the human-in-the-loop steps (selection, this refresh, outline authoring) are unmined.
- oral-only: none directly; the corrections rest on OH-4/OH-5.
- fit: #4 spine (arguably the reflexive centre B named at T-61) / #5.

### T-94 — The audio subsystem: an AI-generated creator surface that did not exist at snapshot, engineered to withhold and to be droppable
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — the information-withholding rule, the offline-audition-fails mixing lesson and foley-not-score accessibility are stated by no existing theme.
- thesis: Game sound arrived post-snapshot as AI-generated cues governed as data, and its design rules are the same distrust-and-restraint posture applied to the model: sound withholds information rather than conveying it, never carries meaning alone, and is built to be cut without breaking play.
- lanes: 4 (with 2 at the mixing/build seam)
- origin: emergent (no snapshot theme touches audio)
- support: S7-020, S7-021, S7-022, S7-023, S9c-058, S9c-059.
- counter-evidence: the surface is deliberately *minimized* and cuttable (S9c-058, S7-021) — a restrained, droppable creator surface, not a rich one; overlaps T-52 (droppability) and T-75 (balance-as-data), which each own a facet.
- gaps: no atom on how the cue *assets* were generated (tool/prompt) beyond the manifest; per-cue provenance sits in S9c-060's unmined manifest work.
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section / #2 video beat

### T-95 — The graph-first scenario model: a mid-implementation rewrite that deletes the lock and makes failure structural
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — continues T-05's temperament-removal arc and reshapes T-41's factory; an authoring *architecture*, not a control-axis or loop.
- thesis: Scenarios were re-architected during implementation from timeline-first, temperament-locked to an endings-first graph (endings → routes → gates → knowledge → timeline derived last) in which failure is where the agent's reach stops, not where a conditional fires — replacing an authored lock with graph shape.
- lanes: 4
- origin: emergent
- support: S2-071, S2-072, S2-074, S2-077, S9c-065, S9c-066 (schema side S7-027/28/29).
- counter-evidence: it did not ship clean — S9c-066 (a gate shipped unrepaired), S2-084 (repairs created new defects), S9c-048 (the "138 is a guarantee" framing is statistically leaky, ~0.81 joint on run 1); S2-073 wanting p=1 on the fail edge sits in tension with T-72.
- gaps: whether the older packs (우는다리) migrate fully to the graph model or stay hybrid — the corpus shows only re-hardening (S2-085, S7-034), not rebuild.
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section / #3

### T-96 — Silent structural hazards native to the graph datapack format — invisible to every automated gate, caught only by hand
- verdict: **proposed** (impl-2026-08-10) — net-new this sweep; has NOT been through director selection, and selection is the director's call.
- #4-role: <proposed: **section**> — a structure-level twin of T-45 (content fidelity); kept net-new because it is about the graph format's own machinery.
- thesis: The new graph format introduced a hazard class: structural edits that destroy or reroute meaning while every compiler, schema and lint check stays green — caught only by manual probing and human review.
- lanes: 4 (with 2 at the tooling seam)
- origin: emergent
- support: S2-075, S2-076, S9c-047, S9c-064.
- counter-evidence: **all four were in fact caught** — by engine-probing (S2-075/76), by `text_head` (S9c-047), recorded pre-emptively (S9c-064). "Tooling cannot see them" holds only at the *automated-gate* level; each produced a new required check.
- gaps: whether a unique-clock-per-node lint rule was actually landed (S2-075 only *demands* it).
- oral-only: none
- fit: #4 section / #2 (review-catch beat)

# Merged and tombstoned records

Kept as pointers, not drops — per `theme-format.md`, folding a duplicate must not lose
the trail that led to it.

### T-39 — The record is append-only; failures are preserved on purpose
- verdict: **merged-into:T-60** — near-duplicate *within Pass A*. A T-39 (append-only
  record, lanes 1/3) and A T-60 (nothing erased, reversals annotated in place, cross
  1/2/3) assert one discipline from two angles; Pass B saw it as a single theme (B T-07),
  which is the reading adopted. All 21 of T-39's atom ids are carried in T-60, along with
  its counter-evidence, gaps and the RUNLOG append-only check it proposes.
- provenance: A-only as a *record*; the merged theme T-60 is `both`.

### T-35 — [merged into T-12] The instrument was usually the defect, not the model
- verdict: **merged-into:T-12** — Pass A's own merge tombstone, carried forward unchanged.
  A3 proposed this as a standalone S3 theme and A5/A6/A8 proposed the same shape from S6,
  S8 and S9b; the cross-slice version is T-12, and the S3-specific counter-evidence
  (S3-005, S3-029, S3-032, S3-058 as genuine model-side behaviours) is carried there.
- provenance: A-only. Not a Phase 3 decision — recorded so the 69→68 substantive count
  reconciles.

**Phase 3 note on proposal 1 (no decision, an observation only):** the reconciliation
did produce independent pressure toward it. The reflexive layer is asserted by both
passes (T-61 = A T-61 + B T-10) rather than by B alone, so if Phase 5 adopts the lane it
will not be adopting a single pass's framing artefact.

**Phase 3 note on proposal 3 (no decision):** the merged T-59 now carries both the
copy-forward failure class (A) and the unguarded-deploy-organ reading (B). Whether that is
one theme or two is the same question as whether lane 2 splits, so proposal 3 and T-59
should be decided together.

# Gaps still open, ranked, for the pre-Phase-5 sweep

1. **#110 / #116 and the 117 post-snapshot commits.** Chief among all gaps. These are
   exactly where the lane-2 review-panel and integration themes either harden into "the
   method demonstrably works" or get overturned: **T-09, T-10, T-24, T-26, T-30, T-48,
   T-76**, and above all **T-27** — if the tail carries heavy review, T-27 (the panel's
   activity decayed to zero) *inverts*. The deliverable's central "multi-agent review
   works" claim is under-evidenced until this runs.
2. **The DDAY-selection artifacts — located 2026-08-07, still unmined.** *Status changed
   by OH-5: this is no longer a record gap.* `planning/concepts/game-concept-dday-simulation.md`
   (PR #85), `planning/dday-sot.md` and `planning/dday-design-doc.md` (PR #91) exist in-repo;
   mining missed the first because the slug is `dday-simulation`, not `dday`. **T-57, T-58,
   T-63** all now say *located, unmined*. This is the highest-value target in the sweep and
   the cheapest — three known paths, no discovery required. Mining them may also promote the
   07-28 communication-miss candidate into a real theme, and would let OH-2's "retained core"
   and "problems dissolved" claims move from oral to written.
3. **The 41-atom residue** (above). Concentrated in S9b/S9a, so likely the same gap as
   (1) rather than a second one.
4. **No production-model, in-play measurement exists.** Every mechanism result is on
   sonnet/haiku over frozen fixtures; the first Bedrock calls were 08-04. The seeds'
   payoffs — does the illusion read as freedom, does pacing feel like a game, is it
   *fun* — are all unmeasured. **T-02, T-46, T-51, T-72, T-73.** Downgraded from blocker
   to per-theme note by director call; it still bounds what #4 may claim.
5. **Three cheap, high-value single lookups** that Pass A named and nobody has run:
   whether S3-052's owed controls ever ran (**T-19** — it decides the exact wording #4 is
   allowed to use about C-BLOCK, and #4 is itself outward-facing text about C-BLOCK); a
   verdict census over the review submissions (**T-22** — the one number that decides
   whether the three-way split or the thirteen-thread unanimity is typical); and a grep of
   the post-snapshot spec for the adopted design laws (**T-37** — whether the nulls'
   payoff actually reached the engine).
