# Deliverable mining — method and corpus

This directory is the working record of how the Codex-utilization writeup
(`planning/meetings/2026-08-10-openai-pivot.md` plus `AGENTS.md` deliverables)
is being **built**: the project's
own history — documents, commit log, PR review threads — is mined by AI agents
for decisions, reversals, failures, and boundaries, from the "AI director" POV
the competition judges on. Themes are induced bottom-up from that evidence, and
only then is the document written.

The directory is committed on purpose. The mining process is itself an instance
of the thing deliverable #4 documents — AI used for planning-and-housekeeping
work — and committing it keeps the process auditable: every later sweep records
what it covered, and every claim in the final document traces back to a source
listed here.

## Where the atoms are

This directory carries the **method, the manifests, and the outputs**. It does
not carry the ore. The `atoms-S*.md` files — **1,271 atoms** (905 from the
planning/demo phase + 364 from the 2026-08-10 implementation sweep) — are frozen
at the tag **`mining/ores-20260810`** and were removed from the tree there: they
are input to the induction, not a deliverable, and they buried the documents a
reader actually wants. (The earlier **`mining/ores-20260809`** tag remains as
the Phase-1-only 905-atom freeze that Phase 2/3 first induced from.)

Nothing about them is lost. Every theme in `theme-map-passA.md`,
`theme-map-passB.md`, and `theme-map-final.md` cites atom ids, and any id
resolves against the tag:

```bash
git show mining/ores-20260810:docs/deliverables/mining/atoms-S6.md | grep -A12 'S6-024'
```

Each atom in turn cites its own source — a SHA, a PR number, a document section —
so a claim in the final document can be traced to primary evidence in this repo
without the ore in the tree at all. The ore shortens that walk; it is not the
bottom of it. `atom-format.md` documents the record shape, and the S1–S10 slice
table below says what each file covers.

An incremental sweep that produces new atoms writes them into a working copy
restored from the tag, and re-freezes under a new dated tag rather than
reintroducing the files here.

## Method (six phases)

| phase | what | output |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Corpus map** — enumerate every mining target | `corpus-files.md`, `corpus-commits.md`, `corpus-prs.md` (this snapshot) |
| 1 | **Atom mining** — parallel agents sweep each slice, extracting story atoms `{source, date, event, tension/decision, quote, lane}`; no selection, boring atoms kept | `atoms-S*.md` per slice — frozen at `mining/ores-20260810` (was `-20260809` at Phase-3 close), see above |
| 2 | **Theme induction** — cluster atoms bottom-up; pre-existing theme hypotheses compete on equal footing and are reported "unevidenced" if nothing attaches; each theme carries supporting atoms, counter-evidence, and gaps | theme map |
| 3 | **Theme review** — human selects/merges/kills; first moment selection happens | reviewed theme set |
| 4 | **Story bank** — per theme, a narrative with every claim linked to evidence (SHA / PR # / doc §) | story bank |
| 5 | **Assembly** — merge into deliverable #4's structure (subsuming the machine-drafted `../ai-utilization.draft.md` and its open TODOs); feed #2/#3/#5 | the document |

Extraction bias (revised 2026-08-05): the full arc weighted equally —
successes and failures, impressive AI output and human-held boundaries,
discoveries and shortcomings — because deliverable #4's reader is a game
company evaluating AI for its own adoption, not only a judge of an "AI
director." Decisions over descriptions; the reason behind a choice beats the
choice itself.

## Lanes (open-ended)

Atoms are tagged with the lane of AI use they evidence. Starting set — lanes
may split, merge, or die as evidence accumulates:

1. **AI-in-the-game** — runtime LLM calls, the membrane rule, mechanism probes
2. **AI-building-the-game** — super-pipeline: agent-authored PRs, review panels, worktree orchestration
3. **AI-in-planning** — meeting summarization, doc drafting, housekeeping (including this directory)
4. **AI-as-creator** — scenario writing and preprocessing as a Claude Code skill; AI generates candidate 'fun', humans judge it

## Corpus slices

| slice | contents |
|---|---|
| S1 | `planning/concepts/` — the 9 game concepts + briefs |
| S2 | scenarios + PoC — `planning/dday-scenarios/`, `planning/dday-scenario/`, `planning/dday-poc/`, `planning/field-report-poc/`, `planning/paper-tests/` |
| S3 | `tools/probe/dday-mechanism/` — mechanism-direction evidence and decision |
| S4 | `planning/meetings/`, `planning/handoffs/` |
| S5 | `planning/research/`, `planning/legacy-services/` |
| S6 | `docs/` (incl. `status.md` history) + planning root-level docs + repo-root prose |
| S7 | prose inside `data/` and `artifacts/` |
| S8 | commit history of `main` (see `corpus-commits.md`) |
| S9 | PR bodies + review threads (see `corpus-prs.md`) — S9a/S9b demo-era, `atoms-S9c.md` implementation-phase (#140+) |
| S10 | oral history — team-memory accounts of pre-repo / off-repo decisions (see `oral-history.md`); ranks below written sources on conflict, but is the only source for causal ordering of the founding decisions |
| S11 | implementation build-record — `DISCOVERY.md`, `discovery/` (engine e0–e10, client u0–u11), `planning/prds/` (see `atoms-S11a.md`, `atoms-S11b.md`); added by the 2026-08-10 implementation sweep |
| S12 | runtime AI in production — `proxy/`, `proxy/prompts/`, live-LLM wiring (see `atoms-S12.md`); added by the 2026-08-10 implementation sweep |

## Sweep protocol

The game is still being built while mining runs, so the corpus moves. Every
manifest carries a snapshot marker: the `main` commit SHA, the date, and — for
PRs — the latest **merge timestamp** covered. Never the highest PR number. PR
numbers record when a PR was *opened*, not when it landed: at the 2026-08-04
snapshot the marker read "PRs after #139 are unswept", but #110 and #116 both
merged *after* that snapshot, so a number-ordered marker silently excluded the
two largest integration PRs in the corpus. Incremental sweeps mine everything
merged after the marker timestamp, then advance it — the final sweep happens
immediately before Phase 5 assembly.

The **2026-08-10 implementation sweep** covered `5a3c388..8b7651f` (PRs #140–#237,
522 commits) into slices S3–S12, added S11 (build-record) and S12 (runtime AI),
ran the QA gauntlet, and re-froze the ore as `mining/ores-20260810` (1,271 atoms).
The theme map was refreshed incrementally in `theme-map-impl-addendum.md`
(61 attachments + 12 net-new themes T-85–T-96), preserving the 84 reviewed themes.

Known blind spots at the current snapshot:
- **main has since advanced to `51ca8d0`** — a 26-commit tail (through PR #240,
  prompt/scenario/feed hardening) landed after the sweep and is unswept; it is
  for the final pre-Phase-5 sweep;
- atoms mined 2026-08-04 were captured under an earlier *failure-weighted*
  extraction bias (revised 2026-08-05); successes and impressive AI output may
  be under-sampled until a balancing sweep runs (audited before deciding);
- work in flight on active super-pipeline run branches (lands on main later);
- the super-pipeline harness's sibling repo — deliberately out of corpus; its
  design record inside this repo (`planning/research/super-pipeline-game-mod.md`)
  stands in for it;
- AI-assisted meeting work that may be recorded outside the repo.
