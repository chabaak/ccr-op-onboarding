/**
 * The default prompt — this tier's own contribution to every Call 1.
 *
 * Call contracts §6 assigns `FLAW`, `INCIDENT`, and `PRIORITY_LIST` to "the
 * default prompt authored by the D task", supplied by the proxy. They are
 * therefore NOT accepted from the client: a payload carrying them is ignored,
 * because honouring it would let a client rewrite the agent's character. That
 * is why the lookup below is keyed by pack and not simply passed in — the
 * client may name which agent it wants, never author one.
 *
 * ⚠️ PROVISIONAL VALUES. Each entry is copied verbatim from the suite that
 * measured the pack it is keyed to, so the deployed agent matches the one the
 * evidence describes. The D task owns the authored replacements. Changing a
 * line here changes the measured system — treat it as a shape change, not a
 * copy edit, and re-probe the pack whose entry moved.
 *
 * ⚠️ RESOLVED (08-09): these ARE per-scenario. The note this replaces said "if
 * a second scenario wants a different flaw, this becomes a lookup keyed by
 * pack, and the payload has to name the pack" — 멈춘회전문 is that scenario,
 * and `CallRequest.pack` is that name.

/**

 * What stops that from becoming permanent and invisible is on the root side:
