/**
 * A QUIET BEAT — a minute in which nothing authored happened on this run.
 *
 * They were rare and are now the common case. `exposure.extra_condition` is
 * honoured on the prompt as well as on the feed since #238, so a beat whose
 * every authored row belongs to a branch this run did not take hands the model
 * nothing: 멈춘회전문 goes from 2 such beats to 15 of 31 on a no-intervention
 * run. (The 2 predate the filter — the beats carrying G2 and G3 author no
 * timeline row of their own, so an unavailable gate empties them by the D3 rule
 * itself. The hole was already reachable in production.)
 *
 * What made that dangerous is the pairing this file exists to hold:
 *
 *   1. the slot rendered as a BARE LABEL, directly above `다시 서술하지 말고,
 *      모순되지도 마라` — an instruction with nothing to be about;
 *   2. the schema said `2~3개` and the validator refused an empty array, so
 *      producing something was a CONTRACT, not a choice;
 *   3. the only anchor left was the previous beats, so what came back was the
 *      previous beat continued — and it rode `feed.ts:40` onto the paper as
 *      `kind: 'event'`, the same mark and face as a row the author wrote.
 *
 * On these beats the invented line is not beside the record. It IS the record:
 * the beat's only other feed line is a symptom, and the fanfold stopped
 * printing those. So the two halves are tested together — a sentinel without
 * the permission only makes the invention informed.
