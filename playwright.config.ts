// Chromium only, desktop only, minimum viewport 1280×800 (plan-client-build §2).
// The runner is imported from `playwright/test`: the `playwright` package ships
// it, so `@playwright/test` stays out of devDependencies.
//
// ── C5 (SPLIT, ruled 08-04) — three hosts, because they prove different things ─
//
// (a) **the fixture round → `npm run dev`.** spec-client §5.4 ships the fixtures
//     in DEV builds only (`driver/demo-run.ts` returns null when
//     `!import.meta.env.DEV`, inv 11), so the §7 run-through can only exist on a
//     dev host. That is the `dev` project.
// (b) **the artefact truths → `npm run preview`.** A real production build,
//     served as deployed: the pack loads from `dist/data/` (the §3.7 plugin),
//     nothing reaches a third-party origin (inv 10), no debug or fixture code
//     survived into the bundle (inv 11), the desk boots inside the ~1 s budget.
//     That build is `dist/` itself — the artefact judges see — so this project
//     deliberately gets no `--outDir` of its own.
// (c) a demo-mode build is REJECTED: fixture code in a shipped artefact is
//     exactly what inv 11 prevents.
//
// The per-unit specs keep the host they were written and merged against — a
// dev-MODE build served by `preview` out of its own `--outDir`. u11 may not
// move another unit's oracle to a different host on its way past ([u11#c8]);
// `--mode development` is what keeps the fixtures in that build, and the
// separate out dir is what keeps `dist/` the deploy artefact (which
// `tests/fixtures/dev-only.test.ts` and the preview project both grep).
// `tools/e2e/mirror-pack.mjs` copies the pack the §3.7 plugin published beside
// `dist/` into it, because that plugin is 윤석's and this run owns no change to
// it ([u0#c9]).
