# nhn-game-2026

Competition entry for the **NHN AI Game Competition (2026)** — built by a 2-person team.
The game is still unnamed and the engine/genre is not yet chosen; this repo currently holds an
engine-agnostic Vite + TypeScript skeleton that renders a placeholder so the deploy pipeline can
be verified end-to-end.

**Status:** DDAY concept confirmed (2026-07-28) — see [docs/status.md](./docs/status.md)
for current state.

**Live:** https://chabaak.github.io/ccr-op-onboarding/

## Stack

- Vite + TypeScript (vanilla, strict mode) — no game engine installed yet.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # type-check + production build to dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build locally
```
