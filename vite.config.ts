/**
 * Physical architecture §3.7 — datapacks are authored at `data/` (constraint 5)
 * and must reach the browser (constraint 3), but Vite serves `public/` only.
 *
 * **By name, never `data/` wholesale.** `data/` is inputs; anything that ever
 * lands there as an *output* would otherwise be published on the next deploy,
 * and `artifacts/` exists so that never has to be remembered (§3.9).
 *
 * **Build only — there is deliberately no dev middleware.** Vite's dev server
 * already serves the project root, so `data/` is reachable at `npm run dev`
 * without any help; a middleware here would add a second, hand-rolled file
 * server for capability that already exists. The first version had one, and its
 * prefix check ran on the still-encoded path — `%2e%2e%2f` passed the check and
 * then decoded into a traversal out of `data/`. Removed rather than patched:
 * the safest hand-rolled file server is the one that is not written.
 *
 * **By name means by FILE, not by directory.** This copied `data/scenario` and
 * `data/policy` recursively, which published every authoring surface sitting
 * beside the six files the run reads — `draft.md` above all, 44 kB carrying
 * every gate, key condition and truth in the case. The answer key was one URL
 * away from anyone who opened the deployed site. A directory allowlist cannot
 * express "the pack, but not the authoring source it was compiled from"; a file
 * allowlist can, so this enumerates.
 */

/**
 * The scenario parts the run fetches, per pack. Kept identical to `PACK_FILES`
 * in `src/client/driver/live/pack.ts` and `tools/driver/run/pack.mjs` —
 * `tests/invariants/published-data.test.ts` fails when the three drift.
 *
 * `places` / `truths` / `hardening` / `draft.md` are authoring surfaces no seam
 * consumes, and `_schema/` is authoring-time validation. None of them ship.
 *
 * `score` joined the loaders with the scorer (#146) — `createScorer` resolves
 * `units[].predicates` at 21:04 — so it ships too, stripped by
 * `stripScoreNotes` below.

/**
 * Authored fields that ship inside a needed file but say how the mechanism

 * — and `standard_form` reads "갈림길 G1에서, 기질은 기본 stance 매뉴얼 응대를
 * 낸다; 열쇠 조건 k1을 만족하는 문장 주입 시 경청으로 이동한다", which is the
 * answer to that gate written out. `branch_note` is the same for outcomes.
 *
 * Neither is read at runtime — `src/shared/datapack.ts:143-144` declares their
 * types and nothing consumes them — so the deployed copy drops them and the
 * authored file keeps them. `tests/scaffold/published-data.test.ts (g)` holds
 * this to the no-consumer premise: if a seam ever starts reading one, the
 * stripping has to be reconsidered rather than silently breaking it.
 *
 * `key_conditions` joins them (08-08). Stripping `key_examples` — the sentences
 * that open a gate — while shipping the RULE those sentences satisfy was half a
 * door: `{axis: 두려움, referent: 발신자, species: 사실}` is the lock's
 * specification, and the manual's whole premise (§3-5) is that the key is the
 * condition class, not any one string. Whoever reads it knows what to mine
 * without needing the examples. It also carried the last `기질`/`조건절` on a
 * player surface, in `targets_clause` — so the leak closes structurally rather
 * than by finding non-leaking words for a field that should never have shipped.
 * Call 1 receives `GATE_QUESTION · STANCE_SET · TIMELINE_EXCERPT · TEMPERAMENT`
 * (`src/engine/index.ts:86-93`) and nothing else; no seam reads this one either.
