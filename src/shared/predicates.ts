// Pack predicates — the machine-readable form of a condition over run state.
//
// `contract-datapack.md` §3.6: F1/F3/F4 all name the same missing thing, asked
// five times — `score.predicates` · `edge_predicates` · `availability` ·
// `extra_condition` · a place yield's `depth_note`. This module is the one
// reader for all five, so the language has exactly one definition.
//
// It lives in `src/shared/` because both sides need it and the import direction
// (`client → driver → composer → engine → shared`) allows nothing else: the
// driver's scorer reads `score.predicates`, and the engine will read the other
// four. A copy in `src/driver/` would be unreachable from the engine.
//
// ── Total by construction, and that is not a style choice ───────────────────
//
// Nothing here throws. A predicate is authored data, and a malformed one is an
// authoring defect that `npm run datapack:lint` is meant to catch BEFORE a pack
// ships — `problems()` below is what lets it, so lint never re-implements this
// grammar. At run time the answer to a broken predicate is `false`, never an
// exception.
//
// The reason is on the record. `clock.ts`'s `mm()` once threw on an authored
// trailing-plus terminal stamp; the throw unwound through a subscriber into the
// driver's `step()`, and the run died on its final beat with no `run_end`, no
// score and no tally. Predicates are evaluated at exactly that moment — the
// close of the day, on the player's build, against data no test fixture wrote.
// A parse error there must cost one row, not the run.
