/**
 * The view-driver seam — spec-client §5.2, ratified 08-03 with amendments.
 *
 * Everything the client consumes during a run is ONE ordered event stream;
 * everything it emits is one op stream. The run-loop manager's channel is
 * folded onto the same stream (`meta`, amendment d), so there is exactly one
 * in-channel and one out-channel.
 *
 * The block below is lifted from the ratified §5.2 fence unchanged: the only
 * edit this module is allowed to make is prefixing `export`. If a shape here
 * causes friction downstream, that goes to DISCOVERY, not into the type.
 *
 * Types only — no runtime value is emitted, nothing is imported, and the
 * module compiles under `tsconfig.core.json` (lib ES2023, types []).
