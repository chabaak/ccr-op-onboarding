 *
 * ⚠️ **Scope narrowed 2026-08-03**. The proxy renders both
 * message layers, so this file no longer describes prompt payloads — it
 * describes what the client *posts* and what it gets back. The executable form
 * of the output schemas lives in `proxy/src/calls.ts`; a second copy here would
 * have no drift guard.
 *
 * There is no scenario content in this file. Slot *names* live here; what fills
 * them arrives through an engine view.
