/**
 * `{TEMPERAMENT}` renderer — structured `Temperament` pack → the prose the
 * bare slot in `proxy/prompts/judgment/base-v0.4.md` and
 * `proxy/prompts/reporter/base-v0.2.md` expects (contract-engine-composer §4).
 *
 * Pure function of the pack — no fs, no DOM, no clock, no randomness — so the
 * same pack always yields the same bytes (contract §4 invariant 3), and Call 1
 * (GateView) and Call 3 (RoundView) can share one renderer over one value
 * (invariant 1) instead of two copies that can drift.
 *
 * The exact prose SHAPE below is **provisional / 잠정** — contract §4.1 names
 * it "the one item in this contract a work unit must not resolve on its own"
 * and reserves it for S + D. This renderer only has to satisfy §4's four
 * invariants (byte-identical across calls, never empty, deterministic, ships
 * its own header — the slot is bare in both templates) plus carry every
 * authored field without dropping any of them. When S + D land the ratified
 * shape, only the body of this function changes; the export stays the same.
 *
 * The header text below is the one exemplar the spec gives (probe fixture
 * `tests/fixtures/probe/temperament/k1.md`, design decision 6): S + D still
 * own the final call, but this is not a placeholder invented by this unit.
 *
 * D4 / spec S5: this renderer is **total** — no validation, no throw.
 * Validation of authored data is `authoring/lint-datapack.mjs`'s job; a
 * malformed field is guarded and skipped here (never coerced into the
 * prompt), not raised as an error.
