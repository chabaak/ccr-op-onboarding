/**
 * How many runs a sitting gets when the caller does not say.
 *
 * H3 (08-09) — STAYS 4. This was briefly 5, and the reason it was raised is
 * the reason it goes back: four "read as three from the desk" because the
 * file's pages turned on the press rather than at run end, so the last day's
 * file was always built on the previous agent's page. That is a page-turn
 * defect, not an allotment that is one short, and the rest of this branch fixes
 * it (`windows/agent-file.ts`). A number raised to paper over a bug has to come
 * back down when the bug does, or the compensation outlives its cause and
 * nobody remembers it was one (민서, 08-09).
 *
 * A run is an AGENT — the sitting hands the operator one file per day and that
 * day is the agent's whole life — so this is how many agents a judge outfits
 * before the deck is spent. Four, with the pages turning where they should.

   * that never ends still counts) while `endRun` appends, so start 3 and end
   * only 1 and 3 and the second archived id belongs to run 3, not run 2.
   *
   * The pairing is recorded at `endRun`, where `run_count` still holds the run
   * in flight — nothing advances it between a run's start and its end.
   *
   * **It cannot be persisted, and that is a schema limit, not an oversight.**
   * `data/runs/_schema/meta-state.schema.json` fixes `report_archive` as
   * `{"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1}}` under
   * `additionalProperties: false`, so the ratified shape has nowhere to put a
   * number; and `run_id` is `{"type": "string", "minLength": 1}` with no
   * documented grammar anywhere in `docs/`, so no number can be read back out
   * of it either. `metaEvent` therefore falls back to position for ids archived
   * by a PREVIOUS session — which is exact whenever
   * `report_archive.length === run_count` (every started run ended) and a lower
   * bound otherwise. Recorded in `discovery/e8.md`; lifting it needs a
   * `data/runs/_schema` revision, which is not this module's to make.
