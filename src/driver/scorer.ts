//
// It computes nothing about the world. Every value here is a predicate the pack
// authored (`contract-datapack` §3.6) resolved by `src/shared/predicates.ts`
// against `EngineHandle.snapshot()`. If a run's ledger is wrong, the fix is in
// the pack or in the gate that failed to set a flag — never here.
//
// ── Why the shared step is `scoreUnits` and not the port ────────────────────
//
// The two things that consume a score want different halves of it. §5.2's
// `score` event carries `rows: {label, value}[]` — a rendered sheet shows
// labels and has no use for a `u4` — while `contract-run-artifacts`' record has
// `units: {id, value}[]`, because an archive is indexed and prose labels move
// when the scenario is edited. Neither can be derived from the other, so the
// work happens once, here, and each caller takes the half it needs.

 * every run regardless of any stance, so they are the one part of an ending
 * that is not a choice. Everything else a gate can set is left absent, and an
 * absent flag reads false (`predicates.ts` `met()`), so every unit falls to its
 * unconditional rule — which is exactly what the pack's `baseline_summary`
 * describes.
 *
 * ── Why this no longer reads `gates.json` ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to fold in each gate's `default_stance` bucket, on the reading that
 * "무개입 ⇒ every gate falls to its default". That reading does not survive
 * contact with the engine: `default_stance` is what `submitStance` substitutes
 * when CALL 1 FAILED (`src/engine/index.ts` — `fallback`), and nothing else. A
 * run where the player injects no block still puts all seven gates to the
 * agent, which answers them from the prompt and the timeline; `default_stance`
 * is never consulted on a healthy run. Deriving the game's baseline from it
 * meant defining the yardstick as "what a network error would have scored".
 *
 * The floor is the honest counterfactual instead: no gate flag is guaranteed,
 * so none is assumed. It is also stabler — adding a gate, or re-authoring a
 * default, can no longer move the baseline out from under the ledger.
 *
 * Flags only: no predicate reads a scalar today. A pack may leave some meters
 * unbound, so a scalar baseline would be describing variables that do not
 * exist.
