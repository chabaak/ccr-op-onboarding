/**
 * The ports the live driver is built on — PRD decision 15: every cross-module
 * dependency arrives by injection, and every one of them is described here
 * **structurally** so a fixture stand-in and the real module are interchangeable
 * without either side importing the other.
 *
 * Two of the three ports are e0's frozen surfaces widened, not replaced:
 *
 * - `EnginePort` **extends** `Engine`. e3's beat driver is richer than
 *   contract-engine-composer §2 (`current` · `submitStance` · `applyBeatEffects`
 *   · `advance`), and the run's three ingest points (`submitStance` ·
 *   `applyNarration` · `applyReport`) each take `T | null` — `null` **is** the
 *   fallback path. Recovery is the engine's, never the driver's: substituting a
 *   gate's `default_stance` needs a field `gateView()` deliberately does not
 *   expose (spec-engine §5).
 * - `ComposerPort` / `TransportPort` are e0's `Composer` and e6's `Transport`
 *   unchanged, aliased so the driver names one vocabulary.
 *
 * Types only — this file emits no runtime value.
