/**
 * The live driver — engine + composer + transport, bound for real, speaking the
 * §5.2 seam: `ViewEvent`s out, `MembraneOp`s in.
 *
 * The whole file is one ordering, and the ordering is the contract:
 *
 * ```
 * beat_start
 *   gate beat only:  round_open → waiting(judgment,on) → [fallback] → waiting(judgment,off)
 *   engine.applyBeatEffects()            → feed…        (the pre-narration flush)
 *   waiting(narration,on) → [fallback]   → waiting(narration,off)
 *   engine.applyNarration()              → feed…        (the post-narration flush)
 * beat_end
 *   round's last beat:  waiting(report,on) → [fallback] → waiting(report,off) → report
 * ```
 *
 * Four properties it holds, each of which is a test:
 *
 * 1. **It wraps, never mints** (decision 1). `engine.feed()` returns this beat's
 *    lines with ids already minted; the driver keeps a cursor and emits only the
 *    tail on each flush. That cursor is what splits a beat into the two flushes.
 * 2. **`beatView()` is never taken early** (contract §6, spec-engine §4.2). It is
 *    read inline as Call 2's argument, after the beat's effects have landed —
 *    never held from an earlier beat, never captured before `applyBeatEffects`.
 * 3. **`waiting` brackets the transport call only** (decision 4). Composition is
 *    synchronous and unobservable, so leaving it outside the bracket keeps the
 *    pause structure independent of composer timing. A failed call emits its
 *    `fallback` *inside* the bracket (decision 5) and the run continues.
 * 4. **Recovery is the engine's, never the driver's** (spec-engine §5). The
 *    driver branches once, on `result.ok`, and hands the engine `null` — it does
 *    not know what a default stance is, and `gateView()` does not expose one.
 *
 * No `meta` event is emitted here (decision 2): the dependency direction is
 * runloop → driver, so that channel is folded on above this module.
