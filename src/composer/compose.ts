/**
 * The three builders — engine view (+ the player's injected block ids) → the
 * `CallRequest` the bundle POSTs to the proxy.
 *
 * Contract: three builders, `BLOCKS` as a *set* of ids, `{TEMPERAMENT}` as the
 * one pre-rendered slot, no scenario read, and every value arriving through a
 * view. Slot ownership is pinned by `data/contracts/call-slots.json`; the wire
 * shape is pinned by `src/shared/contracts.ts`.
 *
 * Three properties this file exists to hold:
 *
 * 1. **Proxy-owned slots are never emitted.** `FLAW` · `INCIDENT` ·
 *    `PRIORITY_LIST` belong to the default prompt the proxy owns; they are
 *    absent from `JudgmentSlots` by construction, so a client cannot rewrite
 *    the agent's character.
 * 2. **Same block set ⇒ same bytes.** Ids are de-duplicated and sorted by
 *    UTF-16 code unit — locale-free, so a C-BLOCK comparison cannot drift
 *    between two machines. `localeCompare` / `Intl` are banned here.
 * 3. **Purity.** No clock, no randomness, no I/O, no DOM; every array is
 *    rebuilt as a fresh literal so a later mutation of the source view cannot
 *    reach an already-composed payload.
 *
 * `src/composer/index.ts` (the barrel) is e0's and is rewired by a later unit;
 * this module is additive.

/**
 * One template version per call type — both prompt layers exist at each.
 *
 * x12 (민서, 08-10) — bumped onto the prompts PR #234 published: the fiction the
 * client has been shipping for weeks (운영자 + 현장 요원 ECHO) and the one the
 * prompts described (광역 재난상황실의 야간 통제관) were two different games, and
 * this line is what finally picks the second one up. `judgment v0.5` /
 * `narration v0.5` / `reporter v0.4` carry the recast, the register split
 * (Call 3 존댓말, Calls 1–2 clipped 해라체), the one-NPC-one-line rule and the
 * branch for a beat where the agent said nothing — which is most of them
 * (`driver.ts:133`).
 *
 * IT LANDS SECOND, AND THIS IS THE SECOND. `proxy-deploy.yml` and the Pages
 * `deploy.yml` both fire on push-to-main and run concurrently, so a client that
 * asks for a version the proxy has not deployed yet makes `proxy/src/prompt.ts`
 * throw `unknown_template_version` on every call — not a soft fallback, the
 * whole desk. The prompts merged in #234 and their proxy deploy went green
 * before this moved. Versions are additive and the old ones are still in the
 * bundle, so the ordering only ever costs a delay, never a break.
