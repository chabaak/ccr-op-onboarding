 * The round event assembler (contract-engine-composer §5) — the `EXPERIENCED`

 * Its input table has exactly three rows: authored script events, every beat's
 * Call 2 output (post-drop), and the gate beat's `utterance` plus `inner_note`.
 * Symptoms are **not** in that table and are excluded here.
 *
 * This is the one place `inner_note` is allowed to be read. It reaches the
 * player only through the report; it never enters a `FeedLine`, never appears
 * on the timeline, and no other view exposes it (§8-5). The note sits
 * immediately **before** its beat's utterance, mirroring call contracts §3's
 * field order — deliberation, then the line that came out of it.
 *
 * Nothing here mints. `EXPERIENCED` is prose handed to a prompt, not sentences
 * the player can mine, so this module takes no allocator — which also keeps a
 * retune of the wording below off the D1 golden entirely.

 * Line prefixes, one per §5 row. The exact prose is **provisional**: §5 fixes

 * table makes a retune a one-line change instead of a hunt.
 *
 * `UTTERANCE` was `'[통제실] '` until the fiction moved (prompts judgment v0.5 /
 * narration v0.4 / reporter v0.4). There is no 통제실 — the agent is a field
 * officer at the site's crisis post, and reporter v0.4 both asks it to record
 * its own speech as an event and forbids system vocabulary from its world. A
 * place name that exists nowhere is exactly the ghost-entity vector the prompt
 * work removed, and this one had a second route to the player: on the Call 3
 * fallback path `assembleObjectiveLog` keeps the utterance row, those lines are
 * minted on the `f` channel and shown verbatim. `[무전]` names the medium, which
 * is the honest contrast to `[속내]` — what was thought, then what went out on
 * the line. `tools/tests/run-record.mjs` regenerates and compares fixture output
 * in temp directories whenever this moves.
