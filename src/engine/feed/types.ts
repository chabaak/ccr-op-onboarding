/**
 * The feed builders' input and output shapes.
 *
 * Owner: e4. These are the seam types `buildFeed` / `buildReportSentences` /
 * `assembleExperienced` speak, and nothing else in the repo declares them —
 * `src/engine/index.ts` (e0's skeleton) owns the *view* types, this file owns
 * the *builder* types the views will eventually be assembled from.
 *
 * Two rules are encoded here rather than remembered:
 *
 * 1. **`inner_note` is a field of `RoundInput` and of nothing else.** The beat
 *    input carries `Pick<JudgmentResponse, 'utterance'>`, not the whole
 *    response, so `buildFeed` cannot reach the note even if a caller shoves it
 *    into the object (contract-engine-composer §8-5).
 * 2. **Everything the builders read is `readonly`.** They are pure functions of
 *    their input (physical §3.2); widening to `readonly` makes an accidental
 *    write a compile error instead of a determinism bug.
