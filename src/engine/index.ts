/**
 * State engine — deterministic, isomorphic, DOM-free.
 *
 * Owner: 윤석 (architecture track). IMPLEMENTED — the header said "Stub." from
 * the e0 skeleton and was never updated when e2/e3/e4 filled it in. The public
 * surface below is live and `createEngine` is bound by the composition root.
 *
 * Its **public surface** — what the composer may call — is fixed as
 * `gateView()` · `beatView()` · `roundView()`, each returning a snapshot of
 * plain data, never a live handle into state. This module also owns the round
 * event assembler. Its internals are:
 *
 * What lands here, per that spec: the run state, the per-beat delta journal
 * (`{variable, before, after, cause}`), the symptom renderer, and the beat
 * chain — *stance → apply its (gate, stance) delta → resolve the outcome
 * bucket → evaluate that bucket's edge predicates against the **updated**
 * state*. The delta lands before the predicate is read; reversing it changes
 * routing while still looking deterministic, which is why it gets a test of
 * its own.
 *
 * Two properties this module exists to preserve:
 *
 * 1. **Free text has no state authority.** The engine consumes exactly one
 *    field of model output — `stance`. Utterances, inner notes, NPC lines,
 *    reports: rendered, never read for state (W4 / I3).
 * 2. **The engine is indifferent to the variable list.** Variables, delta
 *    tables, and predicates are data. Binding a concrete list with the winning
 *    scenario must touch no code in here; if it does, the engine has absorbed
 *    scenario content.
 *
 * Compiled by `tsconfig.core.json`, which omits the DOM lib — `document`,
 * `window`, and `fetch` do not resolve in this folder, by design.
 *
 * This file carries e0's frozen public surface (the three views, `feed()`)
 * unchanged, plus `createEngine`'s body: the composition root that binds the
 * beat & round driver (`./beat`), the state core (`./state`) and the feed
 * builders (`./feed`) into one object. Nothing beyond this barrel imports
 * those three folders directly — a caller that needs an engine calls
 * `createEngine`, never `createBeatDriver` itself.
