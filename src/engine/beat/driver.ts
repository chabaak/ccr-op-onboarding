 *
 * - **spec-engine §4.1, the gate beat.** stance → apply that bucket's deltas
 *   and flags → *then* evaluate the edge predicates. Reversing the last two
 *   still looks deterministic and still returns a node, but it routes the run
 *   off the pre-delta state. `submitStance` is written so the state core's own
 *   call log proves the order.
 * - **spec-engine §4.2, every beat.** the beat's effects land, the journal
 *   closes, symptoms render — and only then is Call 2's payload reachable.
 *   `beatView()` throws until `applyBeatEffects()` has run, so a caller cannot
 *   narrate a beat that has not happened yet.
 *
 * The state core arrives by injection (PRD decision 15) — this file imports no
 * concrete engine, only the port type.
