// [u4] AGENT FILE — 요원 파일 · 프롬프트 편성 (spec-client §4).
//
// The window assembles four components and owns nothing else: the ruled file
// head, the §0–§5 dossier, the deploy zone and the stamp. The membrane state
// lives in the SlotBoard (one owner, `components/slot-board.ts`); the run state
// this file keeps is the two things the seam tells it — the current run, and
// the run it deployed for.
//
// U3 (playtest g3-1) — TALLY dissolves: this window also drives the day's
// turn. `shell/run-state.ts`'s `'tally'` phase now means "the day is closed,
// awaiting the turn", and its two surfaces are the terminal record (REPORTS)
// and this window's merged deploy control. The hold/settle logic below is
// ported from `windows/tally.ts` (deleted this unit) with its DOM targets
// retargeted from the old wait line and its own new-run button onto the one
// control `components/deploy-button.ts` now builds.
//
// Import-safe by contract (u3): no DOM at module scope, no stylesheet import,
// no sibling window import, nothing from engine or composer (C8 / inv 12), and
// no fixture module — carried ids resolve through the report index (D13).

// `const WAITING = '……보고서 정리 중'` stood here, and its own comment gave it
// away: "verbatim from `windows/tally.ts` — diegetic, never a spinner". It was
// the mechanism x6 removed from the fanfold, wearing the same `……` leader,
// mounted in a different window — which is why a sweep of the feed did not find
// it. It printed under the DEPLOY control for the length of the settle hold.
//
// The note is BLANK across the hold now, and nothing the operator could act on
// went with it: the control is disabled for that whole stretch whatever the
// line says, and the moment the release lands the note becomes the one thing
// in the loop worth reading — FILED_NOTE's instruction, LAPSED_TAIL's degraded
// day, or SPENT. A wait line reports that the desk is still working; a release
// reports what happened. Only the second is news.
//
// `SAY_HOLD_TAIL` below survives on purpose. It is not drawn either (the live
// region is clipped off-screen since x6b) and it is the one channel where the
// hold is worth saying: a screen-reader operator cannot see that the button is
// disabled, so silence there would be a dead control with no explanation.

   * (the reveal ran to its last character, or 건너뛰기 landed it), and
   * `mountCover()` (the cover arrived whole with nothing to land).
   *
   * `viewing !== 0` IS THE GUARD THAT MATTERS, and it exists for `landCover`'s
   * THIRD caller. `turn()` lands the reveal whenever any page other than the cover
   * is mounted — that is the whole of "turning away and back shows it whole" — and
   * that call must not arm anything: the operator who has turned the page has
   * already done the thing this cue would be asking for, so hinting at `›` there
   * would be the desk pointing at a gesture it just watched. `turn()` assigns
   * `viewing = clamped` before it reaches that branch, so reading `viewing` here
   * answers it without `landCover` needing a parameter or the callers needing to
   * agree on one. The cover is always page 0 (`pages()` builds it first), so
   * `viewing === 0` is exactly "the cover is the mounted page".
   *
   * `!coverDone` keeps it off a reveal that is still printing. Both callers set or
   * check that first, so this is belt-and-braces — kept because it makes "the cue
   * cannot run over the typing" a property readable at this one site rather than
   * one traced through two callers.
   *
   * `motionless()` is NOT consulted, and that is a decision rather than an
   * omission (민서, 08-10 — the intent is "once the cover is readable, point at the
   * way out"). Under `prefers-reduced-motion` `mountCover` sets `coverDone` with no
   * typing at all, so the cover is readable the instant it is mounted, and that is
   * the operator who most needs the mark: they got no reveal, no 건너뛰기, no beat
   * of motion to tell them the document had finished — just a page of prose and no
   * indication that there is anything after it. The BLINK degrades to a static red
   * box under the same media query (`@keyframes pgCue` ends at `opacity:1`), so
   * what they get is a still mark and not a flashing one, which is the honest
   * reading of both requests at once. It arms in the e2e lane too, where
   * `motionless()` is the determinism gate — harmless, because `harness.ts`'s
   * `boot()` clicks `›` at once and spends the latch a second before the wait ends.
   *
   * NOTHING DISARMS IT. If the operator leaves the cover inside the second the
   * timer still fires and `pgCueArmed` still latches — `paintPgCue` is the

   * watching arrive at the speed a radio delivers it. The cover is the opposite
   * job — a document the operator is being made to slow down over — and it
   * wants a beat the shared model has no term for at all: a short one between

   * being true the moment x7 doubled them — at 45/130 the same page took 22.5 s
   * and the comment still claimed fifteen. So the rule this leaves behind: a

  // SLOWED (x7, 민서 08-09, measured on the built page): 22 → 45 per character

  // read — the eye arrived after the sentence had, which defeats the whole
  // reason the cover types at all. The between-lines pause was right at 340 and
  // is untouched; what was wrong was the rate WITHIN a line, so that is the only
  // thing that moved. The word pause had to move with it: at 45 it was barely
  // two characters' worth and did not read as a pause once the characters
  // themselves cost 45.
  //
  // …AND EASED BACK ~20% (x10, 민서 08-10): 45 → 36 per character, 130 → 104 per
  // word. Two adjustments to the same two numbers in two days, so the reading is
  // written down rather than left to be inferred from the arithmetic: 22 was too
  // fast and 45 OVERSHOT. 민서's words for the current pace are "just a little
  // bit slow" — not wrong, not unreadable, a beat longer than the reading it is
  // pacing, which is what an overcorrection feels like from the other side. x7
  // fixed a real failure and went past the middle doing it; 36 is the middle it
  // was reaching for (22 → 45 → 36), and it keeps the thing x7 bought, because a

  // characters of the rate beside it, so 130 left against 36 would have started
