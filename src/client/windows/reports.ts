// [u6] REPORTS — 부검 · 리포트 (spec-client §4 REPORTS row, §7 #4/#5).
//
// The window is wiring and nothing else: it subscribes to the §5.2 seam, keeps
// the filed reports by round, and hands three collaborators their inputs —
// `report-archive.ts` (the run/time rail), `report-view.ts` (the two documents
// and the replay) and `minable-sentence.ts` (the marks and the mine reducer).
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do: re-segment or re-classify anything (the
// sentences arrive with their authored ids and species, §5.2), keep a clock or
// a timer of its own (the driver's pump is the only one), reach into a sibling
// window (mining emits an op at the seam; where the card lands is the store's
// business), or touch engine/composer (C8 / inv 12).
//
// U3 (playtest g3-1) — TALLY dissolves: the day's results became a fourth
// collaborator. x13 moves the visible tally under AGENT FILE's DEPLOY row, but
// this window still owns the `score` event: it gives the rail a record identity,
// builds the model from the event, and gates the count-up on the paper. The
// record renders from the `score` event alone (inv 6 / inv 12) — no pack read.
//
// x12 (민서, 08-10) — WHAT ARRIVES IS NOT WHAT IS SHOWN, and that is the one
// structural change since. This window took the §5.2 stream literally: a
// `report` typed the round's write-up in the frame the seam emitted it, and a
// `score` started the record's count-up in the same beat. Since x11 the LIVE
// FEED types its lines and paces them, so at that moment the fanfold is still
// tens of seconds back, printing the beats the write-up is about — the day's
// outcome appearing above a paper still printing what caused it.
//
// So the ARRIVING document waits for the paper: `shell/feed-reach.ts` publishes
// where the fanfold has got to, and `afterPaper` below holds each report until
// the feed has walked past that round's `report` event — which is the round's
// last beat printed. The record's count-up waits for the `score` the same way,
// because the fanfold mints the 집계 line from it and the two are one count.
//
// NOTHING ELSE WAITS. A report already in the archive, one the operator picks
// off the rail, a document redrawn because the rail reconciled — all of them
// draw synchronously, exactly as before. The gate is on arrival and on nothing
// else, because what it protects is the ORDER two surfaces say a thing in, and
// a document being re-read has no order left to protect.
