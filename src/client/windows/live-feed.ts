// [u3#c6 → u5] LIVE FEED — the window body, and the one handle that drives it.
//
// 실시간 무전 피드. u3 owns the frame; u5 fills this file and only this file,
// so no later unit has to touch a shared barrel or index.html.
//
// This module is deliberately thin: `run-feed.ts` owns the fanfold and every
// line it prints, and everything here is the seam between that component and
// the shell. Two rules bind it:
//
//  * [u5#c6] the window owns NO clock. `seek` and `rate` move the DRIVER's
//    clock and then let the driver release what is due — they never land a line
//    themselves, never hold a timer, and never read the wall clock. Pausing the
//    driver's clock therefore stops the feed dead, which is the whole point.
//  * [u5#c9] nothing here touches run text at all — it never sees one.
//
// Import-safe by contract: no DOM at module scope, no stylesheet import, no
// sibling window import, nothing from engine or composer (C8 / inv 12).

 * The dev/test handle, the feed's counterpart to the shell's `window.__shell`:

 * run needs to be driven at test speed. ×1 is ~77 s of real time for the whole
 * day, so `seek` is the only way to reach the run's terminal inside an e2e
 * budget — it is a jump of the driver's clock, not a replay of its own.
