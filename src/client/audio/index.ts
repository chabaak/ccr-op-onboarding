// afford to miss. This module carries none — every cue below is redundant
// reinforcement of something already on screen, so a muted desk, a failed
// asset fetch and a browser that blocks the audio context all leave a game that
// is completely playable (plan-audio §2 rule 3). That is why nothing here
// throws and nothing here blocks boot.
//
// It is also a pure OBSERVER, never a third channel. It reads the ratified §5.2
// event stream through `driver.subscribe`, and it reads the DOM the windows
// already wrote — `[data-op]` (the membrane census marker each of the five
// controls carries), the `.hidden` class the window manager toggles, and the
// text the report typewriter paints. It sends no op, mutates no window, and no
// component imports it. Deleting this directory changes nothing but the sound.
//
// Wiring: `shell/boot.ts` calls `installAudio` once, after the desk exists.

     * reverses was written on this very line. It used to read: *"Both wait for
     * the desk (`deskReady`): the unlock above may have happened at the door,
     * and the opening belongs to the desk."* That was sound while the bed was an
     * OPENING — a thing that establishes, expires, and is therefore worth
     * spending where the player can hear it. 08-09's `deskHolds` made the desk
     * bed a ROOM that holds for the whole session instead, and a room the
     * operator signs into was already there before they arrived. Holding it
     * behind the sign-in plate and the manual sheet meant the first thing this
     * layer did with the room was start the fan a minute into the sitting.
     * 민서's call: the room is there from the login screen.
     *
     * "From the login screen" can only mean FROM THE FIRST GESTURE THERE. A
     * browser suspends an AudioContext built outside a user gesture, so there is
     * no sound on the first painted frame for any layer to ask for — which is
     * why this hangs off `unlock()` (the gesture) rather than off a timer, a
     * promise or a bare call at boot. The door is a good place for it: it asks
     * for fifteen keystrokes (`shell/sign-in.ts`) and sounds its own
