// The browser twin of `tools/driver/run/pack.mjs`.
//
// e9 reads the pack off disk with `node:fs`; the deployed client cannot, so the
// same six files are fetched instead. Nothing here interprets the pack — it
// parses the JSON the engine already declares types for and hands it on, so the
// two loaders can only disagree about *transport*, never about content.
//
// `baseUrl` is injected rather than read off the page: every module under
// `src/client/driver/` is held free of DOM globals by
// `tests/driver/import-direction.test.ts (j)`, and the shell already knows the
// deployed base. Same reason `fetch` arrives as an argument.
//
// Physical §3.7 is what makes this reachable at all: `vite.config.ts`'s
// `copyPackData()` copies `data/scenario` and `data/policy` into `dist/`, by
// name, so the pack ships with the bundle.

/**
 * The seven files the run reads. `places` / `truths` / `draft` remain authoring
 * surfaces no seam on this path consumes — fetching them would invent a
 * dependency and cost three more requests on the judge's first load.
 *
 * `score` JOINED THE LIST when the tally stopped being empty. The comment here
 * used to name it alongside the other three, and that was true for as long as
 * nothing built a `ScorerPort`: the file was an authoring surface because no
 * seam read it. It is now the only input to the ledger the run closes on, so
 * the choice is one more small parallel GET at boot or a TALLY that opens
 * blank. `copyPackData()` already ships the whole directory (physical §3.7), so
 * nothing about the deploy changes.
