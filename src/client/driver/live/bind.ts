// The browser binder — the one place the merged `src/**` modules are wired into
// a runnable desk, and the only place `createLiveDriver` is called from the
// client. The twin of `tools/driver/run/bind.mjs`, which does the same job for
// the headless run; keeping the two symmetrical is what makes a headless replay
// evidence about the thing the judge plays.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. There is no engine logic here, and no view logic either.
// Every delta, symptom, id, feed line and routing decision comes out of
// `createEngine`; every pixel is the shell's. This file only threads pack data
// in and hands back the three things the adapter needs to open a day.
//
// Import direction (physical §3.1, revised 08-03): `client → driver → composer
// → engine → shared`. `src/client/driver/` is the ONE place under `src/client/`
// allowed to name engine or composer — `tests/scaffold/layout.test.ts (e)`
// enforces the rest, and this wiring is the reason that exemption exists.
