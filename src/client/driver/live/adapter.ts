// The live driver, wearing the shape the desk already binds.
//
// `createRunLoopDriver` established the pattern: a FACADE over a `FixtureDriver`
// rather than an edit to one, so nothing upstream of the §5.2 seam can tell the
// difference (inv 12). This is the same move with a different inside — e7's
// `LiveDriver` instead of the fixture — and the shell's boot sequence does not
// change shape because of it.
//
// ── The one design decision here: who leads, the clock or the engine ─────────
//
// The fixture holds its whole stream up front, so the CLOCK leads and events are
// released as their stamps come due. A live run cannot do that: a beat's events
// do not exist until the model has answered, 3–4 s for a gate beat and 6.8–10.0 s
// for a round's report (measured 2026-08-04; PR 138).
//
// So the clock follows the engine, and is CLAMPED to the frontier — the latest
// beat stamp the engine has actually produced. Within a beat the fixture's rule
// is unchanged (events release as the clock reaches their stamps, so the desk
// still reads at a human pace); at a beat boundary the clock simply stops until
// the next beat exists. Three things fall out of that, and none of them needed
// special-casing:
//
//   · Waiting is diegetic (architecture §4 latency rule 3) — the desk sits at a
//     stamp with a `waiting` marker rather than freezing mid-animation.
//   · Prefetch (rule 2) — once the current beat's events have all been released
//     the next `step()` is already in flight, so the model thinks during the
//     player's reading time. This is not an optimisation bolted on; it is what
//     "kick as soon as the queue is drained" means.
//   · A paused desk (rate 0) never runs ahead: the clock cannot reach the next
//     frontier, so no further step is kicked. The operator's ▶ is the throttle.
//
// DOM-free, like every module under `src/client/driver/` — the globals guard
// in `tests/driver/import-direction.test.ts (j)` covers this folder too. Real
// elapsed milliseconds arrive through `advance()` from the shell's frame
// callback, exactly as the fixture's do.
