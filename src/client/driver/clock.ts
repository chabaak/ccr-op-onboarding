// MS_PER_SIM_MIN per sim minute, rates ×1 / ×4 / pause, hard stop at the run's
// end stamp. The reference drove it from the browser's frame callback and kept
// the accumulator in a module global; here the pump is an explicit `advance()`
// so the driver stays view-agnostic and deterministic under test.

 * Minutes since midnight for an `"HH:MM"` seam stamp.
 *
 * THE TRAILING `+` IS PART OF THE VOCABULARY, not a typo. Scenario timelines
 * can close on a `+` stamp — "immediately after that minute" — and `engine/beat/
 * clock.ts` gives it a sub-minute sort weight rather than a minute of its own.
 * `buildSchedule` keeps the authored string verbatim on `Beat.clock`, so the
 * live driver emits it on that beat's `beat_start`/`beat_end`, and this parser
 * is what the live adapter measures those stamps with.
 *
 * Rejecting it therefore killed the RUN, not the parse: the throw unwound
 * through the adapter's `absorb` subscriber into `step()`, whose rejection the
 * adapter grades as a defect and stops on — so the final beat, `run_end` and
 * the whole TALLY never happened on a player build. `shell/pack.ts` already
 * strips the same `+` off the clock band for exactly this reason; the seam's
 * stamps needed it too.
 *
 * A whole-minute clock has nowhere to put the weight, and it never needed one:
 * `21:04+` releases with `21:04` and stream order keeps them apart, which is
 * the ordering the `+` was carrying in the first place.

 * A seam stamp as a CLOCK COLUMN should print it.
 *
 * The trailing `+` is an ORDERING weight, not a time — `mm()` above resolves
 * `21:04+` to the same minute as `21:04`, because "immediately after 21:04" has
 * nowhere to live on a whole-minute clock and never needed one. A gutter that
 * prints it is showing the reader a timestamp that does not exist.
 *
 * It reached the screen the moment the run started finishing: until the `+` was
 * parseable the final beat threw, so its four feed lines — the closing tally
 * among them — never arrived. Fixing the run is what put the stamp on the desk,
 * so the display rule lands with it.
 *
 * Total by construction: anything without the suffix is returned unchanged, so
 * this can sit on a render path without a parse that could throw.
