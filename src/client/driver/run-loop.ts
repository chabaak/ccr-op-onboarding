// [u7] The run-loop driver — what `new_run` means when the day starts over.
//
// `fixture-driver.ts` says of the op: *"the fixture keeps the scripted run; a
// live driver would rebuild it"*. This is that rebuild, as a FACADE over the
// fixture driver rather than an edit to it: one `FixtureDriver` in, one out,
// so nothing upstream of the seam can tell the difference (inv 12) and the
// ratified driver stays untouched.
//
// Two things have to survive the swap, because the shell binds them once at
// boot and never looks again:
//
// - **the listener set** — `game-clock`, the three windows and the run counter
//   all subscribed to the facade, so the facade keeps the set and re-binds the
//   inner driver underneath them;
// - **the clock** — `shell/boot.ts` hands `driver.clock` to the game clock and
//   pumps `driver.advance()` off the frame callback, so `clock` here is a
//   stable proxy whose getters delegate inward.
//
// The op itself is answered by the run's own canned response first: the client
// asked the membrane, and only a driver that said yes rebuilds. The last run
// answers `{ok:false}` — there is no next day to open.

  /* ── the BUILD hold (spec-client §5.1) ───────────────────────────────────
     `BUILD → (deploy) RUN`: the day does not begin until a file is committed,
     so nothing the RUN prints may reach a window before the operator's press.

     The shell opens the desk with `start()` + `advance(0)` (`shell/boot.ts`
     step 5) so the run's `meta` — the counter, the pips, the callsign the
     fanfold's header carries — is on the desk the moment it boots. That
     release also carried everything else stamped at the opening minute, which
     on the demo run is the first script event and 서지형's first line: the
     LIVE FEED printed the case's opening while the file was still empty and
     ECHO had not gone in. The run-state reducer already refused to leave
     BUILD for that batch (`shell/run-state.ts`) — the paper just never got the
     same rule.

     So the hold lives HERE, one layer above the replay: the fixture driver
     still releases on its own clock and nothing about its contract moves
     (inv 12), and this facade — which already owns what the desk has SEEN
     across the loop — is what decides when the desk may see it. */

   * `stampOf`). `meta` carries none — it describes the day rather than
   * happening inside it — and everything else unstamped (`report`, `waiting`,
