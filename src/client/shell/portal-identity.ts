 * x1 (08-08) — the portal is renamed and its vocabulary de-escalated.

 * one case, one shift and a finite set of calls, not a national disaster, and
 * a portal that announces 재난 in its own title sets the player up for a scale
 * the game never delivers. The name, the code it abbreviates (NDSP = National
 * Disaster Simulation Portal → ERR = Emergency Response Room), the issuing
 * body and the 災 chop all moved together — a half-renamed portal reads as a
 * bug, not as restraint.
 *
 * The code is load-bearing beyond the chrome: `windows/agent-file.ts` prints
 * it as the document number (`문서번호 ERR-2/AF/…`), which `e2e/agent-file.spec.ts`
 * pins.

 * The card the door TYPES ITSELF as the operator presses keys (`shell/sign-in.ts`).
 *
 * There is nothing to authenticate: the sign-in screen is a scene, and the two
 * fields are rendered as static text, never as a form (spec-client §3
 * invariant 1 — the membrane admits no free-text surface anywhere, and
 * `tests/shell/no-free-text.test.ts` holds that line at source level). The
 * account is the terminal's, which is why it lives beside the portal's own
 * identity rather than in the scenario pack.
 *
 * x9 — the two fields were PRE-FILLED and the door opened on one press. Now
 * they start empty and fill one character per keystroke, and this card is the
 * script: `userId` is typed first, then `secret`, and the LOGIN control is dead
 * until both have landed. The values are therefore load-bearing arithmetic as
 * well as copy — 7 keystrokes and then 8, because that is what they are long —
 * so `tests/shell/sign-in.test.ts` pins both lengths.
 *
 * THE MEMBRANE IS THE POINT OF THE MECHANIC, not a compromise with it. The
 * operator presses keys and the terminal writes what the terminal was always
 * going to write; `doorFill()` takes a COUNT and never a character, so there is
 * no path by which what was pressed becomes what appears. The player's hands
 * are on the desk and their words are not in it.
