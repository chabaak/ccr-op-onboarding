// ⚠ PLACEHOLDER — SYNTHETIC, NOT AUTHORED CONTENT. The shell has to hand the
// driver a `FixtureRun` to open on, and the authored demo run is u2f's work,
// blocked on `src/shared/segment.ts`. So this is the smallest stream that is
// still a real one: the run's opening `meta`, and nothing else. No test may
// assert its numbers — the chrome is verified by the relations between them
// (pips === run + runs_left), never by their values.
//
// What is NOT synthetic: the clock band. `end` is the scenario's own terminal
// out of the pack, so the desk really does run toward the case's 21:04.
