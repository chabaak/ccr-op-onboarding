// The two ways the sitting ends — the curtain the portal drops on a day that
// closed for good.
//
// WHAT IT IS. The same plate the briefing uses, walked three times, on the far
// side of the shift instead of the near one: `shell/manual.ts` opens the
// sitting with 임용 → 시뮬레이션 대상 → 파견과 재시도, and this closes it with
// 시뮬레이션 종료 → 훈련 강평 → 임용 확정 (or 평가 보류). Reusing that plate is
// not economy — it is the portal keeping its word. The document that issued the
// terminal is the document that takes it back, so the operator recognises the
// hardware of the last screen from the first one, and the only thing that has
// changed between them is what it says.
//
// TWO ENDINGS, ONE TRIGGER EACH. GOOD is the day whose `score` closes on
// `RESCUE_TOTAL` — on pack 멈춘회전문 that is zero, reachable by either of the
// two winning routes. BAD is the day that closes with no runs left to spend.
// GOOD WINS when both land on the same day: an operator who empties the dome on
// their last try has passed, and the counter is not the thing being judged.
//
// IT IS AN OBSERVER, exactly like `shell/tutorial.ts` and `audio/index.ts`. It
// reads the §5.2 stream and the DOM, sends no op, mounts no control on the
// desk, and nothing imports it but one call at the bottom of `bootShell`. It
// does not touch `windows/reports.ts` or `components/score-tally.ts` — the
// ledger's landing is read off the `data-tally-state` attribute those modules
// already write, the way the ear reads it. Delete this module and the desk
// plays identically; it simply never stops.
//
// THE HELD BEAT is why the curtain does not ride the `score` event directly.
// The record takes some nine seconds to print itself out and roll its headline
// to the day's number, and a veil that rose on the event would rise across that
// count — the operator would be reading a plate about a number they never got
// to see. So the walk waits for the ledger to reach `final`, holds two more
// seconds with the finished number sitting alone on the desk, and only then
// covers it.
//
// AND THE TAIL IS PART OF THE SAME PATIENCE (x11, 민서 08-10). The record is not
// the only thing still writing itself when a day closes: the LIVE FEED prints
// through a paced reveal queue and the day's last minutes are its most crowded,
// so at `score` the fanfold is still some way behind the run. It used to be made
// to catch up in one frame — `run-feed.ts` dumped its whole queue on `run_end` —
// which is why the veil could come down at a fixed distance from the ledger and
// be sure the paper had stopped. The dump is gone, so the distance is no longer
// fixed and the walk asks instead: `shell/feed-drain.ts` publishes what the feed
// still owes and this waits for it to reach zero. 민서: "If the tail is still
// typing, nothing should stop it, not even the ending."
//
// ONCE PER PAGE LOAD, and the guard is a module-level flag rather than anything
// persisted: a judge who reloads gets a fresh sitting (H2, `run-state.ts`), and
// a sitting that can end is a sitting that can end again.
//
// Import-safe (u3 / inv 12): no DOM at module scope, no stylesheet import,
// nothing from engine or composer. The three-plate copy and the arithmetic
// under it are pure functions, so the whole of what this module SAYS is
// testable without a desk to say it on.

 * has no such lines: it interrupts a day that is still running, or one that has
 * not been started at all, and it does so on purpose. Making the preview queue
 * behind the fanfold's pacing would be the review lane waiting on the very thing
 * it exists not to wait for. (In practice a reviewer opens it at the hand-over,
 * where the desk is held at rate 0 with nothing queued and `feedDrained()` would

  // to be armed while the record it is watching is still `pending`. Put any wait
  // in front of it and a drain that outlasted the ledger's ~9 s count would arm
  // the observer onto an attribute that had already reached its last value: the
  // ending would then wait for a mutation that is never coming, and hang for the
  // rest of the sitting. The two waits are not interchangeable, however alike
  // they look on the page.
  //
  // `feedDrained()` goes SECOND, between the ledger and the beat, and the beat
  // is what decides it. HELD_BEAT_MS is not a delay, it is a held frame: two
  // seconds of the finished number sitting alone on a desk that has stopped
  // moving. Spent while the fanfold was still printing, it would be two seconds
  // of paper scrolling under a number nobody was being given time to read, and
  // the veil would then land on the very frame the last line arrived in — the
  // beat consumed by the drain and no stillness left anywhere. Waiting here
  // keeps the beat's meaning by widening what "finished" covers: the record has
  // landed, the paper has caught up, and only then does the desk get its pause.
  //
  // The feed's own 집계 line is inside this wait, which is the neatest statement
  // of why it exists — the ledger's headline and the fanfold's closing line are
  // two printings of one count, and covering the paper before the second one
  // lands would tear the day's last sentence in half.
  //
  // NO CEILING on it, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. A timeout
  // could only fire by covering a tail that was still typing, which is the exact
  // failure this whole change removes; and the count's only writer is the pump
  // that empties it, so "it never reaches zero" is a defect in the feed to be
  // fixed there. `tests/shell/feed-drain.test.ts` is what stands over that.
