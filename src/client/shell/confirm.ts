// The portal's confirmation plate — the one thing that stands between a
// finished agent file and the day it goes out on.
//
// WHAT IT IS. 배치 is irreversible: the press locks the file for the sitting
// and opens the day it was built for (W4 merged those two into one control).
// Until now that was a single unguarded click, and the file it commits is the
// only thing the operator authors all day. So the press asks first.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a window. The desk's windows are furniture the
// operator arranges — they drag, collapse, close and stack on a `--z` ladder,
// and every one of them is something you can put down and come back to. This
// is a question, and a question you can put down is not being asked. It has no
// title bar controls, it does not enter `WINDOW_REGISTRY` or the taskbar, and
// `applyLayout` never sees it: it is centred on the screen and it holds the
// screen until it is answered.
//
// It borrows the DOOR's plate instead (`shell/sign-in.ts` / `styles/signin.css`
// — the LED head, the chrome gradient, the sealed rule under the header),
// because the door is the other moment in this portal where the terminal asks
// the operator for something rather than showing them something.
//
// THE MEMBRANE HOLDS HERE TOO (spec-client §3 invariant 1). Two `<button>`s and
// static text. Nothing here is an `<input>`, nothing is contenteditable, and
// `tests/shell/no-free-text.test.ts` holds that line at source level.

/**
 * The plate's copy, for the agent the press commits.
 *
 * x5 — it STATES rather than asks, and the two answers name the act.
 *
 * It used to ask '인수인계 사항을 잘 작성하셨나요?' and answer 예 / 아니오. Three
 * things were wrong with that. A yes/no pair puts the operator's own judgement
 * of their work between them and the button, and the honest answer at the
 * moment you press DEPLOY is always yes — so the question was a speed bump, not
 * a decision. `배치` is warehouse vocabulary for something that is a person
 * going out on a shift. And what actually cannot be undone was buried in the
 * small print: the file locking is a consequence, the agent leaving the radio
 * is the loss.
 *
 * So the plate says what is about to happen, then what it costs, and the button
 * says 파견 — the operator confirms an ACT they can name, not their own quality
 * control. `취소` and `파견` are also not near-homographs the way 예 / 아니오 are
 * on a plate you have already dismissed forty times.
 *
 * A function, not a constant: the body names the agent, and the agent is
 * `windows/agent-file.ts`'s to know (M1 — the callsign is per sitting).

/**
 * x7 — THE PLATE NAMES NO AGENT (민서, 08-09).
 *
 * It read `${callsign}에 대한 인수 인계를 완료하여 현장에 파견합니다.`, and the
 * callsign was the wrong half of it twice over. On the first press there is no
 * agent to name — the page is deliberately blank until this press names it, so
 * the plate was announcing a name the file itself had not printed yet. And on
 * every later press it repeated a word the operator had just spent a day
 * reading. What the question is actually asking is whether the HANDOVER is
 * finished; who carries it is the file's business, and the file says so.
 *
 * The parameter went with it rather than being ignored: a callsign argument
 * that no longer reaches the copy is an invitation to put it back.

 * ESCAPE IS 취소. The plate carries no close control by design — the two
 * answers are the only way out of it, and neither is a dismissal. But a modal
 * layer with no keyboard exit is a keyboard trap (WCAG 2.1.2), and the safe
 * answer to an unanswered question about an irreversible act is "no". So the
 * key is bound to the cancelling button rather than to a third outcome.
 *
 * Re-entrancy: `openConfirm` mounts one plate. A second call while one is open
 * answers the second immediately with `false` rather than stacking two
 * questions over one desk — the caller here is a single button, so this is a
 * guard, not a flow.
