// How far down the day's stream the LIVE FEED has PRINTED — the one thing a
// window may ask about a sibling's paper, and the only way it is allowed to ask.
//
// x12 (민서, 08-10) — THE OUTCOME WAS ARRIVING BEFORE ITS CAUSE. `windows/
// reports.ts` subscribes straight to the §5.2 stream, so a `report` event typed
// the day's write-up — and a `score` started the terminal record's count-up —
// in the frame the seam emitted them. Since x11 the fanfold TYPES its lines and
// paces them, so at that moment it is still tens of seconds back, printing the
// beats the write-up is about. The operator read the conclusion of a round over
// a paper that had not yet said what happened in it.
//
// The old answer was a hold in the other direction: `run-feed.ts` carried a
// `REPORT_HOLD_MS = 9000` that STOPPED THE FEED while a report typed, sized when
// the feed lagged the seam by a beat or two. Once the paper became a typewriter
// that hold was making the thing that was already behind fall further behind the
// thing that had overtaken it. It is gone, and it is not what this replaces: the
// gate runs the other way round now — the paper is never held for the document,
// the document waits for the paper.
//
// THE CUE IS THE DEQUEUE ITSELF, and that is why this module is so small.
// `createRunFeed`'s `receive` pushes EVERY `ViewEvent` onto the reveal queue,
// `report` and `score` included, and since x11 an event that prints nothing
// costs the pump no time. So the feed already walks past the `report` event in
// stream order, at exactly the moment it has finished printing everything before
// it — which is that round's last beat. Nothing here counts events, compares
// clocks or is told a beat index: the feed says where it is, and REPORTS waits
// for the place its document belongs to.
//
// A shell-owned slot is what makes that legal, exactly as `shell/feed-clock.ts`
// is for the stamp and `shell/feed-drain.ts` is for the tail: `components/
// run-feed.ts` publishes, `windows/reports.ts` awaits, and neither reaches the
// other — a window may not reach a sibling (C8).
//
// Import-safe: no DOM, no timer, no wall-clock read, and no import at all.

 * alone would have yesterday's round 1 releasing today's round 1 the instant it
 * arrived, which is the exact defect this module exists to remove, restored on
 * the second day of every sitting. The run is the discriminator both ends
 * already hold: REPORTS pairs the report with the run its last `meta` named
 * (`windows/reports.ts`'s `sitting`), and the feed reads the same number off the
 * same `meta` as it applies it — in stream order, so the two cannot disagree
 * about which day a report belongs to.
 *
 * There is deliberately no cue for a `feed` line. What a caller wants to know is
 * "has the paper reached the thing my document is about", and the only documents
 * on this desk are a round's report and the day's record.
