// The sheet the portal issues at sign-in — the last thing between a judge and
// the desk itself.
//
// x5b (08-09) — IT IS A PLATE NOW, NOT A WINDOW.
//
// It never was a desk window (it is outside `WINDOW_REGISTRY`, `applyLayout` and
// the taskbar, because it is a document the portal issues once rather than an
// instrument the operator keeps), but it still WORE the window frame: a file
// tab, a title bar, a close control, a scrolling bond sheet and a footer. That
// is a lot of furniture for something you read once and dismiss, and every
// piece of it was a promise the sheet does not keep — the tab implied a filing
// system, the title bar implied it could be moved, the close control implied it
// could be put down and come back to. It cannot. It is a question the portal
// asks before it hands over the desk, which is exactly what `shell/confirm.ts`
// already is, so it wears that plate: same head, same body, same button.
//
// x5c — AND THERE ARE THREE OF THEM. x10 (08-10) — NO, TWO.
//
// One plate, advanced ONCE: 임용 → 모의 과정, with 다음 · 시뮬레이션 시작. Two
// plates still make each one a beat the operator has to press through, which is
// the only pacing an onboarding gets; what changed is that there are no longer
// three things worth a beat.
//
// WHAT WAS CUT, AND WHY. x5c's middle plate was 시뮬레이션 대상 / '실제 사건을
// 재구성한 시뮬레이션입니다.' — it said that the first simulation replays the real
// incident and that the operator should watch it, and then the third plate
// explained 파견 and 재시도. Both were written when this plate was the only
// surface on the desk that could explain anything. It is not any more:
// `shell/tutorial.ts` walks EIGHT coach marks over the live windows (plated by
// `shell/coach.ts`), pointing at the feed, the two report sections, the
// extraction, the 인수인계 slots and the 파견 button, in the order the operator
// actually uses them. A plate that narrates the mechanics in front of a desk
// that is about to demonstrate them is a wall between the judge and the game,
// and the judge has sixty seconds.
//
// So nothing survived x5c's plates 2 and 3, and step 2 below is NEW copy rather
// than a merge of them: 모의 과정 안내 says what the terminal IS and what the
// allotment is, and never what to do with either.
//
// THE DROPPED CONTENT IS GONE ON PURPOSE (민서, 08-10). Do not fold "the first
// run replays the real incident, watch it" back into either surviving plate. The
// first run demonstrates that BY BEING it, and a briefing that announces it in
// advance spends the only surprise the opening has.
//
// What is left is the two things a notice genuinely has to say before a
// simulator starts. First, who the operator is — and, load-bearing, that they do
// NOT go to the scene; that is the one fact about the job the desk itself cannot
// show, because a desk that never dispatches the operator looks the same as a
// desk whose operator has not been dispatched yet. Second, that what follows is
// a rehearsal, with a fixed number of attempts and one thing to maximise.
//
// The plate is NOT rebuilt between steps: its head, its body and its button
// label are rewritten in place. Remounting would replay the entrance animation
// and the veil on every step, and would drop focus off the control the operator
// is pressing — the whole briefing is meant to be walkable by pressing Enter.
//
// It borrows `confirm.css`'s `.cf-*` classes outright rather than restating
// them — `styles/win-manual.css` carries only the layer, the entrance, the step
// transition and what a one-button foot needs, and `index.css` imports it AFTER
// `confirm.css` so those few overrides land. Nothing here builds a `.win`, so
// `body.booting .win{visibility:hidden}` no longer has to be opted out of, and
// `audio/index.ts`'s window-open observer cannot see it at all.

 * split is not decoration — the white line is the CLAIM the plate is making and
 * the grey lines are what follows from it, so a reader who only takes in the
 * two white lines still leaves with 임용 → 모의 과정: you have been appointed to
 * the room, and what you are about to operate is a drill. That is the frame the
 * whole sitting hangs in, and it is all the briefing is now for — the mechanics
 * are the coach walk's job (see the header).
 *
 * The `n / 2` counter is NOT in these strings. It rides the head's own meta slot
 * (`CONFIRM_DEPLOY` uses the same slot for 되돌릴 수 없음) so it lands in one
 * fixed column across both plates and reads as progress rather than as part of a
 * title that happens to end in a fraction. `counterOf` derives it from this
 * array's length, so dropping x5c's middle plate re-counted the walk from 3 to 2
 * with no other edit anywhere.
