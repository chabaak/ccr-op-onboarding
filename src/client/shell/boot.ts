 * (`shell/feed-clock.ts`), so the pump has nothing left to paint and the `paint`
 * parameter is dropped rather than handed a no-op: a callback nobody passes is
 * an invitation to start feeding this view again from the sim clock, which is
 * exactly the disagreement the seam was built to close.
 *
 * TWO PUMPS, ONE TIMELINE. A frame callback does not fire in a hidden document
 * — a background tab, a minimised window, a window another app fully covers —
 * so a rAF-only pump stops the day dead the moment the player looks away, and
 * the run only resumes when they look back. That is why the same build "runs in
 * the background" for one of us and freezes for the other: it is not the
 * machine, it is whether the browser still calls the frame the desk rides on.
 *
 * So when the document goes hidden the frame pump hands over to an interval,
 * and hands back on return. The clock survives the swap because `advance()`
 * takes ELAPSED REAL MILLISECONDS, not a frame count (`driver/clock.ts`): a
 * throttled tick that arrives once a minute carries a 60_000 ms delta and moves
 * sim time by exactly as much as 3600 frames would have. `release()` drains
 * every event now due in order and `kick()` chains the next beat off its own
 * promise, so a coarse tick loses no beat — it only repaints in bursts, which
 * is all a tab nobody is watching can do anyway.
 *
 * Both pumps read `performance.now()`, the same clock rAF stamps its argument
 * with and the one that keeps running while hidden, so `previous` carries
 * across a swap with no seam: no minute is double-counted and none is dropped.
