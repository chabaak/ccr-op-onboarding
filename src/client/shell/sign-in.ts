// The portal's front door — plan-playtest O1, the opening.
//
// A judge who opens the page lands on a portal they have to sign into, not on
// a desk they have to decode. That is the whole job of this module: establish
// WHO the operator is and WHAT the terminal is for, in the same CRT the desk
// lives in, and then get out of the way. It owns no run state, reads no pack
// and never touches the driver.
//
// THE HOLD IS NOT OURS. `desktop-dressing.ts` already holds the desk
// (`body.booting`) and reveals it; O1's constraint is that the opening must not
// build a second one. So the desk boots at full speed BEHIND this layer and
// `bootShell` simply defers its existing `revealDesk` call until the door — and
// then the manual — is done with the screen.
//
// THE MEMBRANE HOLDS AT THE DOOR TOO (spec-client §3 invariant 1). The two
// fields are `<span>`s carrying `SIGN_IN`'s text; nothing here is an `<input>`,
// nothing is contenteditable, and the one control is a real `<button>`.
//
// x9 — THE OPERATOR TYPES THE CARD IN, and that is the membrane stated out loud
// rather than a hole in it. The fields used to arrive pre-filled and LOGIN was
// live on the first frame, which made the door a picture of a login: the one
// thing on screen was already done, and the press was a formality. So the wells
// start empty and each keystroke lands one character — `OP-2291`, then eight
// mask glyphs — and LOGIN is dead until the fifteenth.
//
// WHAT was pressed never reaches WHAT appears. `doorFill()` below takes a COUNT
// and returns `SIGN_IN`'s own two lines sliced to it; the key's identity is read
// exactly once, by `countsAsStroke()`, and only to decide whether the press was
// a press at all. Mash the keyboard and the terminal still types its own badge
// number. That is the membrane as a MECHANIC — the player's hands are on this
// desk, their words are not in it — and it is why this screen can ask for
// fifteen keystrokes without becoming a text field.
//
// A TAP COUNTS AS A KEYSTROKE. There is no focused field here to summon a soft
// keyboard, so on a touch screen `keydown` never fires and a key-only door would
// be a dead end for every phone that opens the deployed site. `pointerdown` on
// the layer is the same gesture by another instrument, and on a desktop it pays
// again: the player who clicks the empty well instead of typing is taught the
// mechanic by the character that appears under their cursor.
