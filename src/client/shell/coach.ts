// The onboarding walk's coach mark — the plate, the leader and the scrim.
//
// WHY THIS OVERLAY IS ALLOWED TO EXIST. `shell/tutorial.ts` spent forty lines
// arguing that the walk must NOT be an overlay, and every word of that argument
// is still true: a class riding the element cannot be off by a pixel and cannot
// intercept a click, while an overlay has to track a rect through two scroll
// containers, a window drag and a page turn. What changed is not the argument,
// it is the requirement. That mark was SILENT — a window or a control glowing
// red in turn, with no sentence anywhere on the screen — so the operator watched
// the desk point at something and had to guess what it was pointing out. A walk
// that has to SAY something needs somewhere to print it, and printed copy needs
// a plate. A plate is DOM.
//
// So the two costs are PAID here rather than avoided:
//
//   the rect  — this module owns no cached geometry. A mark holds a SELECTOR and
//               never an element, and every measure pass re-resolves it and
//               re-measures from scratch, exactly as `shell/thread-layer.ts`
//               does: every desk signal collapses into one dirty flag and one
//               animation frame, and the next frame simply tells the truth. It
//               has to be that way — REPORTS repaints its sentences on every
//               typewriter tick and the AGENT FILE rebuilds its whole page on
//               `turn()`, so an element captured once is stale within a frame.
//   the click  — the scrim and the leader are one `pointer-events:none` SVG, and
//               only the plate takes pointer events. The desk stays fully
//               operable underneath a mark, which is load-bearing rather than
//               polite: most steps come down when the operator DOES the thing
//               the mark points at, so a mark that swallowed that press would
//               deadlock its own walk.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a window: no title bar controls, no `--z`, not in
// `WINDOW_REGISTRY`, not in the taskbar, never seen by `applyLayout` —
// `shell/confirm.ts` argues that case at length and this plate stands on the
// same footing. Not modal either, and that is where it parts company with the
// confirmation plate: nothing is made `inert`, focus is not trapped, and the
// desk behind it keeps working. Not a product tour: no step counter, no ◂/▸,
// and nothing persisted (a page load is a new sitting — H2 — and gets the walk
// again).
//
// The skin is `styles/coach.css` and every colour and size lives in
// `styles/tokens.css` behind it. This file writes geometry and nothing else, and
// it writes it as custom properties — the pattern `shell/window-manager.ts`'s
// `setPx` established and `tests/shell/shell-source.test.ts` [C12/inv 8] (c)
// pins.
