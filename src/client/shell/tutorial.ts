// The portal's onboarding walk — eight coach marks, once per page load.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. Still not a game tutorial. This portal's fiction is that the
// operator is a new hire on their first shift, and the thing being introduced
// is the PORTAL — which window holds what, which control commits, where a
// sentence goes when you press it. So it teaches the way an internal system
// teaches: it points at what you would use next and gets out of the way.
//
// WHY IT NO LONGER WORKS IN SILENCE. The walk this replaces lit its target with
// a pulsing red ring and carried no copy at all, on the argument — set out at
// length in the header it is replacing — that a coach mark is a product-tour
// bubble and that an overlay would sit on top of the very controls it points
// at. That argument was sound and it lost to the one thing it could not do. A
// window that glows red tells a first-time player that something is WRONG; it
// does not tell them what to read. And the desk has about sixty seconds to teach
// three windows and a mine (CLAUDE.md: the judge experience is the optimisation
// target), which is not enough time for anyone to infer a gesture from a colour.
// Only copy carries that. So the ring is gone and every step says one line.
//
// WHERE IT STARTS, AND WHY SO LATE (x8). The first plate is the LIVE FEED, and it
// does not appear until the day is running — so the whole build phase, the file
// and its page turn and the press that commits it, happens unnarrated. That is
// deliberate: the AGENT FILE introduces itself now (a cover that types its own
// incident brief, a handover that materialises row by row, a press that names the
// agent and then stamps it), and a plate over a document performing its own
// opening is a second voice over the first.
//
// WHAT WAS TRADED. The old walk mounted no DOM — a mark was one class on an
// element the desk already owned — and that property is spent: `shell/coach.ts`
// mounts a scrim, a leader line and a plate with two buttons in it, and this
// module is what puts them up. The guards that pinned "mounts nothing" are
// re-aimed rather than deleted, because the rest of the contract is intact and
// it is the part that was load-bearing:
//
// WHAT WAS KEPT. The walk sends no op, drives no clock and opens no run. Every
// beat it advances on is something the desk was already doing — a press the
// operator makes, a `report` landing, `run_end` off the §5.2 stream. The layer
// is non-blocking by construction (the scrim and the leader take no pointer
// events), so the desk stays fully operable under a plate and an operator who
// ignores the walk plays exactly the game they would have played without it.
// Delete this module and the desk plays identically — which is still the
// property that makes it safe to have this in the tree this close to the
// deadline.
//
// ONCE. `runTutorial` is called once from `bootShell` and a page load is a new
// sitting (H2), so "once per session" and "once per load" are the same promise.
// Nothing is persisted: a judge who reloads gets the walk again, which is the
// behaviour a demo wants and the opposite of what a `localStorage` flag gives.
