 * O3 — the desk's four radio cues, synthesised in place (WebAudio, no
 * assets). Procedural on purpose: no binary ships, so assets-manifest.json
 * (hard rule 5 covers external/AI-generated FILES) stays untouched and the
 * third-party guard has nothing to scan. The cues are radio texture, not
 * music: filtered noise shaped by short envelopes.
 *
 * Every entry point is defensive — no AudioContext, a suspended context that
 * will not resume, a driven browser (`navigator.webdriver`, the same key
 * the door keys off), or the desk's mute toggle all mean silence, never a
 * throw. Audio is garnish: nothing in the game reads back from this module.
 *
 * This module coexists with `src/client/audio/` (the sampled desk layer): it
 * keeps its three radio moments and its no-assets approach, and it honours
 * that layer's ♪ toggle by reading the same storage key before every cue.

 * x9 — one keystroke at the door (`shell/sign-in.ts`).
 *
 * The one cue on this desk that answers the PLAYER's hand rather than the
 * stream, and the only reason it exists: the door now asks for fifteen presses,
 * and fifteen presses into a silent machine feel like a machine that is not
 * listening. Short, dry and high — 26 ms of narrow noise reads as a key bottoming
 * out, where the other three cues are all radio carrier and last a second or
 * more. Quiet on purpose (0.035 against LOGIN's 0.05): this fires fifteen times
 * in a row, and anything that carries at that repetition becomes a rattle.
 *
 * The first tick is usually silent, and that is the same tax `bindRadioSfx`'s
 * unlock pays — a context built inside the gesture that built it is still
 * resuming when this returns. `context()` answers `null` until it is running, so
 * press one is dropped and press two onward are heard. The alternative is
 * scheduling press one late, and a keystroke that clicks after its character has
 * already appeared is worse than a keystroke that does not click at all.
