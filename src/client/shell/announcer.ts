// The desk's LIVE REGION — what an operator who is not watching pixels hears.
//
// `index.html` has carried `<div id="toast" role="status" aria-live="polite">`
// since u3, and nothing ever wrote to it: 30 s of a real run produced zero
// mutations, so the whole desk announced nothing at all while `e2e/a11y.spec.ts`
// asserted the region's ATTRIBUTES and read as tested (R2 on index.html:125).
// This module is what the channel carries.
//
// What it announces is the state an operator cannot afford to miss and cannot
// infer from a document they are already reading: a new day opening, a fallback
// degrading the round, the report landing, the day closing onto the tally. The
// FEED itself is not routed through here — it is a running log, and a log
// belongs in `role="log"` on its own list (`components/run-feed.ts`), not
// re-read as a toast.
//
// x6 — a WAIT is no longer on that list (민서, 08-09). `무전 회신 대기 중` and
// `무전 회신 도착` used to bracket every model call in flight, here and on the
// fanfold's own marker (`components/waiting-marker.ts`, deleted with them). A
// day is seven rounds of three calls, so the two of them were most of what this
// channel ever said — and both say only that the desk is still working, which
// the next announcement proves a beat later with content. The seam still carries
// `waiting` and the live driver still emits it; the toast says nothing for it,
// and the wait is heard as the pause it is. The design note that asked for the
// marker is `docs/design/phase2-ui/README.md`'s latency bullet and the spec's is
// spec-client §3 inv 5 (its component table still lists a `WaitingMarker`);
// both now describe a thing no client draws or says.
//
// Everything below is driven off the §5.2 stream. The one exception is
// `announce()`, which the deploy control calls with the membrane's own answer:
// `deploy` has no event echo on the ratified seam (`shell/run-state.ts` says the
// same thing about the BUILD→RUN edge), so the op's acknowledgement is the only
// signal there is.
