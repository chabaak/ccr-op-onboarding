// WindowFrame — the chrome every desk window reuses (spec-client §6).
//
// Ported from docs/design/phase2-ui/index.html lines 105..120 + 146..148: the
// title bar (dot ·名 · controls), the body and the corner grip, on u1's
// `.win / .win-bar / .win-ctl / .win-body / .win-grip` selectors. The reference
// pinned each window's geometry in the markup; here the frame is built with no
// geometry at all — applyLayout writes `--x/--y/--w/--h` and the manager writes
// `--z`, so nothing is hard-positioned.
//
// x10 — THE FILE TAB IS GONE. It was the frame's first child,
// `el('div', 'win-tab', def.tab)`: a clipped trapezoid sitting 23 px above the
// title bar with a two-letter code in it — `LF` on the LIVE FEED, `AF` on the
// AGENT FILE, `RP` on REPORTS. 민서 (08-10): 제목 위의 RP · LF · AF 태그를
// 없애고, 창 위치는 그대로 둘 것.
//
// The reference's tabs carried INDEXED codes — `AF-03`, `LF-03`, `RP-02`,
// `TL-03`, `BS` across five windows — so a tab said something the title bar did
// not. Ours had shrunk to the initials of the name printed 23 px below it,
// which is x5's argument again (`ko` and `sub` left the registry for it): three
// windows on one desk do not need the same three things named twice, once in a
// shorter alphabet. `def.tab` went with the element — it had no other reader,
// so keeping the field would have left a required label on the registry that
// nothing renders.
//
// A11y ([u3#c5]): the frame is a named region, the title bar is a focusable
// move handle, and both controls are real buttons with accessible names.
