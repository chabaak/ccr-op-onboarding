// DeployButton — the run gate at the foot of the AGENT FILE, and the 파견 완료
// stamp that lands on the paper when it closes (spec-client §6).
//
// Ported from docs/design/phase2-ui/index.html 132..143 + `app.js` `syncDeployUI`
// (292..303) onto u1's vendored `.deploy-zone` / `.stamp` skin.
//
// Split model → builder (u4 D1): `deployView` is pure and is the only place the
// five readable states are decided — the counter, the note, the board's
// `data-state`, the button's, and whether the stamp is down (D11).
//
// U3 (playtest g3-1) — TALLY dissolves: this control now also carries the
// day's turn. Once the run closes (`shell/run-state.ts`'s `'tally'` phase),
// the SAME button becomes NEW RUN — what used to be `windows/tally.ts`'s own
// deleted new-run button. `deployView` resolves which of four faces the
// control wears (`deploy` · `settling` · `next` · `spent`); `buildDeployZone` paints
// whichever one it is handed and decides nothing itself. The settling/next/
// spent note text (WAITING/FILED_TAIL/LAPSED_TAIL/SPENT) is not decided here
// — it is written directly by `windows/agent-file.ts`'s ported hold/settle
// wiring, the same way `windows/tally.ts` once owned its wait line outright.
