// Dossier — the AGENT FILE's sections, the document the operator reads

// (203..232) + `data.js` DOSSIER (37..68) onto u1's vendored `.sect` skin.
//
// The copy is DOCUMENT ART, not engine data: the pack carries no callsign and
// no standing orders. What IS pack-fed arrives as the models' own arguments —
// incident-cover copy to `coverModel`, and the callsign and slot cap to
// `agentModel` (u4 D2/D4).
//
// x7 — 기질 IS GONE FROM THE COVER, and the cover was the only place it appeared,
// so the sealed section has left the product (민서, 08-09; the consequence was
// stated when the call was made). `SealedSection`, `SEALED_COPY`, `SEALED_BARS`
// and `buildRedaction` went with it — nothing outside this file imported them.
//
// The seal's INVARIANT is untouched, and it never was the section's to carry:
// I13 (spec-client §3 inv 4) says 기질 data never reaches the view, and it never
// could, because no model in this file has a field one could be written into.
// That was always the load-bearing half; the bars were art on top of it, and
// `agent-file.test.ts [u4#c2](a)` now holds the invariant on its own. (This
// paragraph deliberately says 기질 and not the English word — [u4#c2](b) fails
// any client source that names the pack's own vocabulary, comments included.)
//
// NOTE FOR A DOC PASS — not done here, no doc is edited by this change:
// `data/contracts/view-driver-seam.ts` and `docs/design/phase2-ui/README.md`
// 65..66 all still describe §3 기질 as a rendered sealed block.
//
// Split model → builder (u4 D1): everything above `buildDossier` is pure.

 * The first deploy is the DEFAULT one — the operator has handed over nothing
 * yet — so the agent who flies it is just ECHO, and the numbering begins with
 * the second agent, the first one the operator actually shaped:
 *
 *   run 1 → ECHO · run 2 → ECHO-1 · run 3 → ECHO-2 · run 4 → ECHO-3
 *
 * The `Math.max` fallback is gone with it. It existed to keep a run of 0 (the
 * pre-first-press desk) off `ECHO-0`, and `run <= 1` already answers that with
 * the same name the first real sitting gets — there is no second spelling of
 * "the agent who has not been shaped yet" left to drift.
 *
 * 사건 개요 on the cover names 요원 ECHO by hand. That is not a coincidence to
 * be tidied away: the file's opening paragraph and run 1's callsign are the

 * does not name that agent until the press opens their day, so between the
 * close and the press the desk has to head a page for someone the authority has
 * not announced. [u7#c3] forbids the WINDOW doing that arithmetic on the
 * authority's numbers, and rightly: `run`, `runs_left`, `carried` and `archive`
 * are the run loop's and the client mirrors them.
 *
 * A callsign is not one of those numbers. The ECHO series is document art this
 * module already mints (`callsignOf` above — the pack carries no callsign at
 * all, D4), so "who comes after ECHO-3" is a question about the DOCUMENT's own
 * numbering and this is where it is answered. Nothing here reaches the seam,
 * decides a run, or survives into a `meta` field; the window still owns only
 * the choice of WHICH agent a page is about, which is a choice and not a sum.
 *
 * The desk never offers this page on the last day of an allotment — `runs_left`
 * is 0 there and `windows/agent-file.ts` reads it before turning — so no agent
 * is ever named who cannot be sent.
 *
 * x7 — it is STILL `callsignOf(run + 1)` and deliberately nothing more. The
 * series renumbered underneath it (run 1 is now plain ECHO), and the one place
 * an off-by-one could hide is the unnumbered → numbered boundary: after ECHO
 * comes ECHO-1, not ECHO-2. Composing rather than re-deriving is what makes
 * that free — there is one mapping and this reads it. `agent-file.test.ts

 * posting order and nothing else — it opened on orders addressed to the agent,
 * so a reader arriving at the desk cold was told what to do before being told
 * what had happened. x7 puts the INCIDENT first and keeps only the two orders
 * that the incident makes sense of: what the agent is for, and how they talk.
 * 행동 원칙 went with 기질 — a principle the operator cannot act on is a third
 * screenful between the incident and the radio.
 *
 * One rule still governs every line: **the file is issued about and to the
 * agent**, so nothing here names a run, a slot, a round or a tally. The
 * operator learns what they may do by reading what the agent was told, and a
 * word that only makes sense from outside the fiction breaks the one surface
 * that has to be believed. `agent-file.test.ts [u4#c2](e)` enforces that.
 *
 * **The `\n`s are load-bearing, and they are no longer only typography.** Each
 * line becomes its own element in `buildSection` below — see the comment there
 * for the reveal that depends on it.
 *
 * The incident facts are selected-pack copy. They are passed in from the window
 * after it reads `data/scenario/<slug>/incidentCover.json`; keeping them out of
 * this module is what lets a pack switch move the cover with the pack. The
 * mission sentence and the dispatch sentence that names the ECHO series stay
 * here because every pack would otherwise restate the same portal invariant.

 * handovers each time. That explanation belongs to the simulation terminal, not
 * to one incident's place, weather, time, or cause. Printed as body prose it
