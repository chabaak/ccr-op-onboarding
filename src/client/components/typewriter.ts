// H3 (08-09) — extracted from `components/report-view.ts`, which owned this
// outright while it was the only surface that typed. It is not any more: the
// AGENT FILE's handover reveals itself the same way when the day settles
// (`components/slot-board.ts`), and two typewriters on one desk running at
// different speeds would read as two different machines. So the arithmetic has
// one owner and both callers import it.
//
// x10 (08-10) — …and the two callers now run it at DIFFERENT RATES, which is
// worth stating plainly because the paragraph above reads like a ban on exactly
// that. It is not: what would read as two machines is two ARITHMETICS — one
// surface pausing between 어절 while the other pauses between sentences, one
// settling on `done` and the other running off the end. The pace is a dial on
// one machine, and it is a dial because the handover is a file the operator is
// waiting to get their hands on rather than a transmission arriving, so it is
// read at a different speed by the same eye. `TypePace` below carries the dial;
// the model is still owned here and only here.
//
// Pure by construction: no DOM, no timer, no wall-clock read. A cursor is a
// function of ELAPSED MILLISECONDS and the lengths it is typing, which is what
// lets the whole thing be proved under vitest's `environment: 'node'` and what
// lets a caller settle it instantly by handing it a large enough elapsed.

 * change to a rate and not to a model. The alternative was a second copy of the
 * arithmetic under different constants, and `windows/agent-file.ts`'s
 * `COVER_MS_PER_CHAR` note is the long argument for why that is only allowed
 * when the SHAPE differs too (the cover pauses between 어절, a beat this model
 * has no term for at all). "The same arithmetic at a different rate" does not
