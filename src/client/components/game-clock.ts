// [u3#c3] GameClock — the topbar's sim clock (spec-client §4 chrome row, §6).
//
// Ported from docs/design/phase2-ui/app.js `paintClock()` (line 171). One thing
// changed, and it is the point of the criterion: the reference kept the time in
// a module-global `S.clock` and ticked it from its own loop. The view still owns
// no clock, no timer and no wall-clock read — it is handed a time and paints it.
//
// x6 — WHICH time changed. This view used to be painted from the frame pump with
// `driver.clock.at()`, the sim clock's own running minute. The LIVE FEED does not
// print that minute as it arrives: it reveals lines through a paced queue and
// holds harder on the beat a report lands in (`components/run-feed.ts`), so the
// chrome ran ahead of the paper by whatever the queue was holding. Two clocks on
// one desk, disagreeing, and the authoritative-looking one — big digits, top
// right, labelled SIM — was the one the operator could not check against
// anything. The chrome now follows the paper: the digits are the stamp the feed
// has most recently PRINTED, off `shell/feed-clock.ts`.
//
// The seam is a shell slot rather than a reach across windows, and the string is
// taken as given: `run-feed.ts` publishes what it printed, already through
// `displayStamp`, so a trailing-plus terminal stamp is resolved once and never
// here.
//
// W4 dropped the other half of the port, `initRate()` (line 201) — the ×1 / ×4 /
// pause row. A day is not a recording to scrub: DEPLOY starts it and the pack's
// terminal minute stops it, so this view now pushes nothing at all.
