// [u6] MinableSentence — spec-client §6 row `MinableSentence`, §3 inv 3 (I1).
//
// A report sentence arrives pre-segmented and pre-classified from the driver
// (§5.2). This module never re-splits it, never decides what kind of sentence
// it is, and never reads what it says: identity is the AUTHORED id and nothing
// else, which is what makes mining, archive highlighting and u8's red thread
// agree with each other across a run switch.
//
// Ported from docs/design/phase2-ui/app.js `minSpan()` / `mine()` /
// `markReportSlots()` (lines 495, 541, 562). The reference kept the marks in a
// module-global `S` and mutated the DOM from inside the click handler; here the
// marks are DERIVED from the driver's own store on every read, and `mine()` is
// a pure reducer that answers with the op to send and the effects to play.
//
// The three functions above `mine()` are DOM-free on purpose — the pure half of
// this unit runs under vitest's node environment.
