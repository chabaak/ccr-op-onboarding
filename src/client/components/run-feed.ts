// [u5] RunFeed — the LIVE FEED window's fanfold.
//
// Ported from docs/design/phase2-ui/index.html lines 149..175 (the fanfold
// body: two sprockets, `#feedScroll`, head / `#feedList` / tail) and app.js
// lines 404..456 (`MARKS` · `feedLine` · `pushFeed` · `prefillFeed`). Two
// things changed, and both are the point of the criteria:
//
//  * the reference walked a module-global array from its own sim loop; here
//    every line arrives on the DRIVER's event stream and lands only when the
//    driver's clock releases it ([u5#c6]). This module owns no timer, no clock
//    and no wall-clock read — its only inputs are `subscribe` and `frame`.
//  * the reference printed a waiting marker for every call in flight and closed
//    it when the answer landed. x6 removed the marker outright, so there is no
//    wait to resolve and `waiting` draws nothing at all — see `appendLine`.
//
// x11 (민서, 08-10) — and the paper TYPES now. A line no longer appears whole
// and then waits its turn; it is printed character by character at a constant
// rate, one line at a time, with a short pause after a row and a longer one when
// the desk clock moves (see the pacing block below). Three consequences are
// worth having in the header, because each of them is load-bearing somewhere
// else in the desk:
//
//  * the arithmetic is `components/typewriter.ts`'s, run at a pace of this
//    window's own. There is no third copy of a type cursor on this desk.
//  * `#feedList` is a live region, so the typing half is hidden from the a11y
//    tree and each line carries a complete sr-only twin — see `lineElement`.
//  * the day now ENDS by draining rather than by dumping: `run_end` no longer
//    flushes, and what the feed still owes is published to `shell/feed-drain.ts`
//    so the ending can wait for the tail. 민서: "if the tail is still typing,
//    nothing should stop it, not even the ending."
//
// x12 (민서, 08-10) — AND THE PAPER IS NOW THE THING OTHER WINDOWS WAIT FOR. The
// same lag that made the ending wait made REPORTS arrive early: a `report`
// typed the round's write-up while the fanfold was still printing the beats it
// describes. So the pump publishes where it has GOT TO — `shell/feed-reach.ts`,
// a cue per opened gate, a legacy cue per `report`, and one for the `score`.
// REPORTS holds each document until the next gate's paper cue, or the score for
// the final round. This window is unchanged in what it prints and in what it
// costs; it simply says so out loud. See `apply`, which is the only publisher,
// and the pacing block below for the hold that went the other way.
//
// The line MODEL is kept apart from the DOM on purpose: `feedLineModel` is
// pure, so inv 2's digit scan ([u5#c3]) runs in `environment: 'node'`.
//
// Renders only ([u5#c9]): `line.text` and `line.speaker` reach the document
// untouched — nothing here slices, pads, counts or reformats them. x8 gives an
// `npc` line a fixed tail AROUND its quote (see `feedLineModel`); the frame is
// chrome authored beside the run text, never derived from it.

/* How the paper prints, x11 (민서, 08-10) — and what it replaces.

   The old pump landed each line WHOLE and then waited 600–2400 ms before the
   next one, priced by how much that next line asked the player to read
   (`REVEAL_CHAR_MS` · `REVEAL_MIN_MS` · `REVEAL_MAX_MS`), with a crowd divisor
   that halved the wait once five events were queued. Two things were wrong with
   it and both are why this block exists:

    * the divisor made the beats with the MOST to read go by FASTEST. A crowded
      queue is a busy minute of the run — three lines of an argument in the room
      — and it was exactly the stretch the pump decided to hurry through.
    * a line that appears whole is a page of a document. This window is a radio
      record printing as the desk hears it.

   NOTHING REPLACES THE DIVISOR, and the lag it bounded is accepted now. Its
   stated job was to keep the feed from falling unboundedly behind a sim that
   emits faster than anyone reads, and the two ways that could hurt are both
   closed: the top bar publishes the PAPER's stamp rather than the sim clock's
   (`shell/feed-clock.ts` — x6), so a backlog never shows as two clocks
   disagreeing; and there is no player-reachable fast-forward at all, because
   `windows/live-feed.ts` gates the whole `__feed` handle behind
   `import.meta.env.DEV` and the bundler folds it out of the player build. What
   is left is a queue that drains slower than it fills for a while and then
   catches up in the quiet. `live-feed.test.ts` pins that ratio to the data
   policy so a re-tune cannot quietly put the paper behind the day.           */

 * The pause after a ROW.
 *
 * The typewriter's `msBetween` is the beat between two sentences of one

 * two utterances and is priced higher than the report body's 130 ms. Same
 * reasoning `slot-board.ts` records for its own pair: the pause only reads as a

   paper printing over it. It was sized when the reveal landed lines whole and

   ahead let the two surfaces meet.

   round's report tens of seconds after the seam emits it — so the hold was
   stopping the surface that was already BEHIND, for the benefit of the one that
   had overtaken it, and every hold put it further behind the next one.

   The gate REPLACED it rather than joining it. Both could not stand: a hold is
   the paper waiting for the document, the gate is the document waiting for the
   paper (`shell/feed-reach.ts`), and running both would be two surfaces each
   waiting for the other to move — nine seconds of stopped paper added to every
   round of a lag the stopping is what caused. The reading the hold was buying

  //  * `tail`   — the spacer is `25cqh`, so it is re-derived from the window a
  //               beat AFTER the box resizes, changing the scrollable height
  //               without either of the other two having changed size at all.
