// [u7] ScoreTally — the day's 집계, printed as record lines (spec-client §6).
//
// Ported from docs/design/phase2-ui/app.js `countUp` (604) and `runTally` (614).
//
// ── x4 (08-08): the ledger became a record ──────────────────────────────────
//
// U3 dissolved the TALLY window and filed this thing at the foot of 현장 기록,
// where it went on looking like the sheet it used to be: a centred head with a
// 집계표 title and a subtitle, a 66px headline number in its own boxed row, and
// a zebra-striped table with a 기준 column and ▲/=/▼ marks. Two documents on one
// piece of paper, and the second one shouted.
//
// It prints as LINES now, in the 현장 기록 column's own format — the same grid,
// the same dotted rule between rows, the sentence starting on the same x. What
// changes is the ink: every line is seal red and bold, because these are the
// only lines on the page that are not a report of what someone saw. One line
// each, in the order the day is read out:
//
//     23시 12분 시점 집계
//     터널에서 나오지 못한 사람: 59명
//     오세라: 사망 · 아홉 번째 문 안쪽
//     …
//     총 사망자 수 60명
//
// WHAT WENT WITH THE TABLE. The 기준 column and the ▲/=/▼ mark are gone, on
// 민서's call (08-08): the record format has one column, and a baseline folded
// into the same line would double every row's length for a comparison the
// operator did not ask for. The seam still carries `baseline` and
// `baseline_total` — the engine's contract is untouched — but nothing on the
// desk renders them any more, so the "무개입 하루 대비" reading now lives only in
// what the day itself says.
//
// The count-up survives, moved onto the closing line's number and given only
// the time that line actually has (`countMs`) — see the cadence note below.
//
// x13 moved the host under AGENT FILE's DEPLOY row; issue 228 moves it again under
// LIVE FEED's paper, while REPORTS still opens and runs it from the `score`
// event so the paper gate and event-local model stay there. The component
// remains the same record printer; only the mount owner changed.
//
// Two things are deliberately NOT the reference's:
//
// - **The settle is derived, not the literal 1400 ms.** The reference's own
//   README calls the count-up "deliberately paced to ~9 s — long enough to
//   cover a report call", and 900 + 500 + rows*640 + 1400 is 7.9 s for the
//   demo's ledger. `settleMs` solves for the 9 s target instead and clamps, so
//   `run_end → final` lands on `TOTAL_MS` for every ledger the seam can carry
//   (spec-client §3 inv 5, latency rule 3).
// - **The cadence is injected.** The reference drove it off the browser frame
//   callback; here it runs on a `Scheduler`, because the active pack's end stamp
//   stops the driver's clock and `advance()` early-returns once it has — a tally
//   that rode the driver's pump could never finish. There is no spinner
//   anywhere: the wait is diegetic and the window owns its line.
//
// Import-safe by contract (u3): no DOM at module scope, no stylesheet import,
// no sibling window import, nothing from engine or composer (C8 / inv 12).
