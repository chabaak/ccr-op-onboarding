// [u11#c12] C14/C15 — the DEV-only surfaces that sit ON TOP of the desk, and
// how a spec that MEASURES the desk gets them out of the way.
//
// `vite.config.ts` folds `__DEBUG_PANE__` to `mode !== 'production'`, so every
// e2e host except `preview` boots with u9d's pane mounted. The pane is
// `position:fixed; left:0; bottom:0; max-width:46vw; max-height:42vh` — it
// covers the bottom-left quadrant of a 1280x800 desk, which is exactly where
// LIVE FEED's resize grip and its lower body live. A pointer press there lands
// on the pane, not on the window, and a geometry oracle written against the
// player's desk reads a window that "cannot be resized" or "does not raise".
//
// Browser specs that measure or press the desk need the player surface, not a
// dev overlay sitting on top of it. This helper hides the DEV-only pane and
// measures the desk the player actually gets. Nothing is skipped and no assert
// is loosened — the pane is absent from the player bundle by inv 11, and
// `e2e/debug-pane.spec.ts` (which owns the pane's own contract) never calls this.
