 * same breath is that same instruction reaching the one surface that had started
 * pacing it, and it is exactly what the desk itself does for a halted clock, a
 * seek or reduced motion. The reveal's PACING is not weakened by it: that claim
 * is u5's, is asserted in `e2e/live-feed.spec.ts` (`the day’s end drains`) from
