// u11 — spec-client §7 items 1–12, the acceptance run-through.
//
// This file IS §7. Every other e2e spec proves a MECHANISM inside one unit's
// slice; this one walks the day once, end to end, and asserts each of the
// twelve sentences by observable outcome (design D3). Nothing here imports a
// unit spec's helpers, and nothing here re-tests a mechanism a unit already
// pins — a red in this file means the RUN-THROUGH broke, and per [u11#c8] the
// fix belongs to the owning unit, never to this file.
//
// HOST: `npm run dev` (C5(a)). Fixtures are DEV-only by design —
// `driver/demo-run.ts` returns null when `!import.meta.env.DEV` (inv 11 / §5.4)
// — so the fixture round CANNOT run on a player build. The artefact truths
// (pack from dist/data, zero third-party, no debug/fixture code in the bundle)
// are asserted separately by `e2e/preview-smoke.spec.ts` per C5(b).
//
// Test titles are load-bearing — [u11#c1]/[u11#c2]/[u11#c3] filter with
// `-g 'acceptance 1-7'`, `-g 'acceptance 8'` and `-g 'acceptance 9-12'`, and
// Playwright matches the DESCRIBE title concatenated with the test title, so
// every test below inherits its filter from its describe. Do not rename one.
//
// C3: no fixture CONTENT is asserted. Every id, number and label is read back
// out of the driver's own stream through `window.__shell.frame()`, so the suite
// binds to whatever run the shell boots.

 * x11 — SETTLE THE FANFOLD (민서, 08-10).
 *
 * The LIVE FEED reveals through a paced queue, and the day's close no longer
 * empties it: `run_end` used to dump the whole backlog in one frame, and it now
 * drains at reading pace with `shell/ending.ts` waiting for it
 * (`shell/feed-drain.ts`). So `drain()` — which releases the STREAM and then
 * waits out the ledger's own ~9 s count — now returns while the paper is still
 * printing, and every read of the fanfold below it was reading a day in
 * progress: short by however many lines the reveal still owed, with the last
 * line it did print stopped mid-word by the typewriter.
 *
 * §7's feed items are claims about WHAT the paper says, not about when it got
 * there, so they settle it and then read it. The pacing itself is u5's own
 * claim and is asserted in u5's own file (`e2e/live-feed.spec.ts`, `the day’s
 * end drains`) — per [u11#c8] this suite does not re-test another unit's
 * mechanism, and it must not silently depend on one either.
 *
 * The helper itself is `flushFeed` from `./fixtures/harness.ts`. It was three
 * identical copies in three specs on the day the reveal became a typewriter;
 * x11 folded it in, because a helper copied three times is three places for the
 * next change to miss.
 */
/**
 * Feed lines as the DOM actually painted them. The kind rides the `fl-<kind>`
 * class (`components/run-feed.ts`), which is also how u5's own handle reads it.
 *
 * x11 — `text` is the line's CONTENT COLUMN, no longer the whole `<li>`
 * (민서, 08-10). A line is printed twice now: `.fl-c` is typed out for the eye
 * and `.fl-sr` carries the complete text for the ear. Reading the `<li>`
 * therefore concatenates the clock stamp, the typed column and a second copy of
 * the same sentence — so `#2`'s stream-order walk would match every line
 * against a doubled haystack (passing on a paper that printed each line twice),
 * and any count of occurrences would be off by exactly a factor of two. The
 * announced column is not skipped: `#2 (c)` scans both, and u5 pins that they
 * agree.
