// [u5] LIVE FEED — the rendered half: a whole fixture round on the fanfold, the
// silent wait, the 17:33 fallback, clock-landed lines, and a surface the player
// cannot touch.
//
// Covers [u5#c2] round renders in order · [u5#c4] silent waiting ·
// [u5#c5] fallback line · [u5#c6] lines land on the clock ·
// [u5#c7] untouchable during a run.
//
// Test titles are load-bearing: the unit's verification commands filter with
// `-g 'round renders in order'`, `-g 'silent waiting'`, `-g 'fallback line'`,
// `-g 'lines land on the clock'` and `-g 'untouchable during a run'`. Do not
// rename a describe block without updating `.claude/super/units/u5.md`.
//
// x6 — `diegetic waiting` became `silent waiting` when the wait markers were
// removed; see that block for why the rename was safe to make.
//
// x11 — THE PAPER IS TYPED NOW, AND IT NO LONGER DUMPS (민서, 08-10). Two
// changes run underneath this whole file:
//
//  * a line's content column `.fl-c` fills character by character, and carries
//    `aria-hidden="true"` so a `role="log"` does not re-announce the line once
//    per keystroke. A new sr-only sibling `.fl-sr` holds the COMPLETE text and
//    lands in one go, so a reader hears each line exactly once. Any read of a
//    line's text therefore has to name which of the two columns it means —
//    reading the `<li>` reads both and double-counts (see `domLines`).
//  * the day's end no longer flushes. `run_end` used to dump the whole reveal
//    queue in one frame; it now drains at reading pace and the ending veil waits
//    for it (`shell/feed-drain.ts`, `shell/ending.ts`). So "the stream is fully
//    released" and "the paper has finished printing" are two different moments,
//    and a test that wants the settled paper says so — see `flushFeed`.
//
// The two handles this suite drives:
//   • `window.__shell` — u3's: `{ frame(), drain() }`, the driver undecorated.
//   • `window.__feed`  — u5's: `{ seek(at), rate(r), flush(), count(), kinds(),
//     stamps() }`. ×1 is ~77 s of real time for the whole day, so `seek` is the
//     only way to reach 21:04 inside an e2e budget (design D13).
//
// C3: no synthetic fixture literal is asserted. The Korean strings that appear
// are the *client's own* component states (`(변화 없음)`) and the reference
// marks, not run content. The wait phrasings used to be on that list; x6 took
// them off it by taking them out of the client.

/* ══ x11 — the two columns of a line (민서, 08-10) ═════════════════════════
   ADDED with the typewriter. The reveal became character-by-character, which
   put a `role="log"` in an impossible position: a live region with
   `aria-relevant="additions"` announces what is added, and a column that grows
   one character at a time is one addition per character. A reader got the line
   spelled to them.

   So the line has two columns now. `.fl-c` is the paper — typed, and
   `aria-hidden="true"` so the log never sees it grow — and `.fl-sr` is an
   sr-only sibling holding the complete text, appended once. Neither is
   redundant and neither is decoration: the operator reads one and hears the
   other, and this block is what keeps them saying the same thing.

   It exists because every OTHER text assertion in this file reads `.fl-c`
   alone. That is right — those are claims about the paper — but it means the
   announced column has no reader anywhere in the suite, and an `.fl-sr` that
   silently emptied, doubled, or fell behind its own line would break nothing.

   "seeking to the terminal minute ends the run, so every queued line lands
   whole in the same turn as the drain above" — true while `run-feed.ts` flushed
   its whole queue on `run_end`, and the reason the chrome's clock could be read
   in the frame after a drain. The dump is gone: the fanfold now drains at
   reading pace after the clock ends and `shell/ending.ts` waits for it
   (`shell/feed-drain.ts`).

   A behaviour that only one comment described was a behaviour nothing was
   holding. This is the assertion that behaviour should have had, and it is
   written from the outside — no handle is asked what it owes, the paper is
