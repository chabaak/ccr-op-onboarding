// Test titles are load-bearing — the unit's verification commands filter with

// during drag'` and `-g 'clipped to visible rect'`. Do NOT rename a describe
// block without updating `.claude/super/units/u8.md`.
//
// C3: nothing here asserts fixture CONTENT. The suite reads the ids the booted
// run actually renders (`#w-rep [data-sentence-id]`) and threads those, so it
// survives u2f replacing placeholder content wholesale. The one literal id used
// for the negative case is the authored grammar `b-r<run>-<channel><nn>`.
//
// It must pass against BOTH servers (dev today, `npm run preview` once u11
// re-points `playwright.config.ts` per C5) — nothing below assumes a dev server.

 * COMMITS the file, so the day after it opens locked and `place()` is refused
 * by `planOps` — every thread oracle in this file went vacuous at once. The

 * the file is unlocked, the day's report is on the desk, and the operator is
 * doing exactly what these tests assert. The tally-window flake the note below
 * describes cannot recur either — U3 dissolved `#w-tally` into REPORTS.
 *
 * C17 / [u11#c12] — RE-AIMED (08-04, u11 attempt 2). This is the setup the
 * file's flakiness lived in. The code here used to close the sheet with its
 * `.wc-close` button, under a comment that said so explicitly: "u7 — the unit
 * that will keep the tally shut until the run ends — has not landed, so the
 * suite closes it the way the operator does". u7 has landed since, and
 * `drain()` flushes the run to its TERMINAL — which is exactly the phase in
 * which u7 OPENS the tally and keeps it open. Closing it by hand fought the run
 * state instead of leaving it: any frame that followed put the sheet straight
 * back up, and while it is up `planThreads` returns [] for EVERY thread, by
 * design ([u8#c1], reference `app.js:579`).
 *
 * That, not the thread layer, was every red in this file: measured 1 in 5
 * full-suite runs and ~60 % under a loaded `--repeat-each`, across the MID-drag,
 * REPORTS-drag and TALLY-open oracles alike, and `#w-tally` read
 * `win win-tally focused` — no `hidden` — at the moment of every single one.
 *
 * `#btnNewRun` is the loop's own way out: it files the closing report, carries
 * the blocks and starts the next day, so the desk is in a RUN phase where the
 * tally is shut because the run says so — and with the clock held at 0 it never
 * reaches the next 21:04. Nothing is skipped and no thread rule is relaxed.
