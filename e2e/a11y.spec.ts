// [u9#c5] PRD §4 a11y asserts — the P1-D structural suite's browser half.
//
// Three things the PRD names:
//   • membrane ops (slot · unslot · mine · deploy · new_run) and window
//     controls are keyboard-reachable;
//   • landmarks/roles are present on the chrome and on each window;
//   • focus order follows visual order at 1280×800.
//
// It also carries the RENDERED-DOM half of inv 1 and inv 2. vitest runs in
// `environment: 'node'` (`vitest.config.ts`), so `tests/invariants/*` can only
// read source from disk; the "…and rendered DOM" clause of [u9#c1] and the
// selector-scoped clause of [u9#c2] can only be honoured in a browser, and
// this file is the only browser file u9 owns.
//
// SCOPE (P1-D scoping rule, [u9#c6]): **unit-scoped, forward-binding**. u4–u8
// are out of scope for this run (C1: blocked on `src/shared/segment.ts`), so no
// membrane-op control exists on the desk yet. The membrane asserts are
// therefore written as *universally quantified over whatever exists*: every
// `[data-op]` control found must be keyboard-reachable, and the census assert
// records how many were found rather than demanding five. They pass on the
// tree at u9's merge and tighten by themselves the moment u4/u6/u7 land.
//
// Titles are load-bearing — [u9#c5]'s verification runs this whole file, and
// `-g` filters in later units may target these describe names.
