// [x3] the onboarding walk — `shell/tutorial.ts` + `shell/coach.ts`.
//
// THE ONE LANE THAT ASKS FOR IT. `tutorialSkipped` is true under
// `navigator.webdriver`, which is every other spec in this directory: a walk
// that dims the desk and scrolls the AGENT FILE under a plate would turn those
// suites into a coin toss. This file opts in by name, `?tutorial=show`, and the
// first three tests are the ones that prove the opt-out is real.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED. The ORDER of the eight plates, the LINE each one prints,
// and what brings each one down — which is the whole of the walk's behaviour
// now that the mark carries copy. The copy is the point of the rewrite: a plate
// on the right target saying the wrong sentence is precisely the failure this
// suite exists to catch, so every step asserts its text and not merely that
// something appeared.
//
// AND THE ONE THING NO SOURCE GUARD CAN PROVE. The scrim must not swallow the
// press it is pointing at. Most plates come down when the operator DOES the
// thing the mark names, so a layer that ate that click would deadlock its own
// walk — and `pointer-events:none` in a stylesheet is a declaration, while a
// click landing on the control underneath is a fact. (f) and (g) below are that
// fact, in a browser.
//
// WHERE THE WALK STARTS (x8). The first plate is the LIVE FEED and it does not
// appear until the day is running, so the build phase — the file, its page turn,
// the press that commits it — is unnarrated. Three plates used to live there and
// (e) is the assertion of their ABSENCE, which is the only kind that proves a cut
// landed. Every test that needs a later plate therefore has to DRIVE the desk to
// the first one; `walkTo` does that.
//
// Timings are asserted as CEILINGS on a wait, never as equalities: the walk is
// decoration and a CI box under load must not turn a slow frame into a red
// build. Nothing here waits a fixed number of milliseconds for a plate — the
// old walk's eight-second hold is gone and plates advance on presses.
