// u11 — C5(b): the PREVIEW smoke, against `npm run preview` of a real build.
//
// The C5 split (08-04) says the preview directive was always about ARTEFACT
// TRUTHS, never about the fixture round: `driver/demo-run.ts` returns null when
// `!import.meta.env.DEV`, so a player build boots an empty desk — no feed
// lines, 0 mined, no thread — by design (inv 11 / §5.4 / u2f#c9). This file
// therefore asserts what only a BUILT artefact can prove and deliberately does
// NOT attempt the §7 round; that lives in `acceptance.spec.ts` on the dev host.
//
// Titles are load-bearing: [u11#c10] runs the whole file.
